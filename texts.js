By the full moon hanging low in the west he knew what he might not have known otherwise: that it was near the hour of dawn. A light mist lay along the earth, partly veiling the lower features of the landscape, but above it the taller trees showed in well defined masses against a clear sky. Two or three farmhouses were visible through the haze, but in none of them, naturally, was a light. Nowhere, indeed, was any sign or suggestion of', 'Other folktales feature clever tricksters who fool other characters. Other tales may tell of witches, thieves, ghosts, cowboys, talking animals, or common villagers. Fables, fairy tales, and nursery rhymes are common types of folk stories. A fable is a short folktale that teaches a lesson about how people should behave. It usually has animal characters that speak and act like people. Fairy tales tell about magical beings such as fairies, elves, dragons, and trolls. Nursery rhymes tell entertaining stories in short, clever poems. People have told such stories to children for centuries.', "So that even if you don't understand the words, you can appreciate and capture the spirit of the beat. This is why music has the platform it does today, as well as the adoration and allure. Instruments play a major role in the art of music. In principle, any object that produces sound can be considered a musical instrument. Dating back over sixty thousand years, the flute is considered by most scholars to be the oldest musical instrument. Today there are many instruments used to produce melodies and sound. This is due in part, to the conversion of cultures that", 'Dolphins look like big fishes, but they are actually mammals. They belong to a large group of animals called whales. Dolphins are closely related to porpoises. Because dolphins and porpoises look so much alike, people often confuse the two. However, dolphins are usually larger and have longer, beaklike snouts. There are more than thirty five species, or types, of dolphin. They are divided into two groups, true dolphins and river dolphins. True dolphins live throughout the world in either salt water or fresh water. The most widespread species are the common dolphin and the bottlenose dolphin. River dolphins prefer fresh', 'You can either search about them online or can call the operations unit and ask your queries. If you do not have any skate parks in your hometown and planning to visit a park out of the town, make sure to check accommodation facilities beforehand. In addition to skateboard helmets and pads, you may also consider carrying an extra skate board in case one breaks. If you have not carried any protective gear along with you, you can ask the locals about the best skate shops around. The locals will also be able to help you with other attraction for', "Most of the time a comet consists of only its nucleus. However, when the comet gets close to the sun, the sun's heat causes it to shed gas and dust. A huge cloud of gas and dust called a coma builds up around the comet. The coma is sometimes larger than Earth. It makes the head of the comet look blurry. When a comet moves even closer to the sun it grows tails. This happens because the sun gives off energy and streams of particles. They push some of the coma's dust and gases out into long streams. Comet tails", 'Sedimentary rocks are formed at the surface of the earth, either in water or on land. They are layered accumulations of sediments, fragments of rocks, minerals, or animal or plant material. If a layer of sediment is buried beneath overlying rock, the layer becomes compacted and may form a layer of sedimentary rock. The sediment becomes cemented together by minerals and chemicals or is held together by electrical attraction. Sand and gravel deposits on beaches or in river bars look like the sandstone and conglomerate they may become. Compacted and dried mud flats harden into shale. Mud and shells settling', 'Carbon materials, usually the most expensive, are probably the highest end in new technology and provide the greatest blend of strength, durability and lightweight. The owner will have to decide what sort of crossbow they purchase depending on what they will use it for and dedication to the use. People who are using their crossbows regularly, whether it be for practicing and competition or for serious hunting trips and big game hunting, will want to focus on higher end crossbows which are most often composed of carbon material. These crossbows are incredibly strong, lightweight, durable and provide the greatest power', 'To understand lightning, you have to start with a storm cloud. It is made of tiny water droplets and ice crystals. The water droplets and ice crystals zip and zoom around inside the cloud, banging into one another. This creates electric charges. Some charges are positive. They rise to the top of the storm cloud. Some are negative. They drop to the bottom of the cloud. Positive charges also build up near the ground. They build up on trees, rooftops, and even our van. The opposite charges attract each other. Negative charges from the cloud zigzag down toward the ground.', "Found in many products from tires to toys, natural rubber is made from the milky sap of the rubber tree. There are several kinds of plants that can produce rubber. One kind, the India rubber plant, is a common houseplant. Most of the world's natural rubber, however, comes from the rubber tree. Rubber trees grow best in hot, humid climates with deep, well drained soil. People grow rubber trees mainly for their sap, called latex. After workers cut a slit in the bark, latex runs out and collects in a cup. This process is called tapping. The slit later closes", 'Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything, then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves. Here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed,', 'Most tarantulas stay hidden during the day and come out at night to eat. They feed mainly on insects but will also eat frogs and other small animals, such as mice, that come along. Some large South American tarantulas make webs to catch small birds to eat. Many tarantulas, however, hunt rather than spin webs to catch food. These hunters use their sensitive hairs to detect vibrations from movements of prey. They strike the animal with their fangs and inject venom into it. Tarantulas then grind the prey into a ball, secrete digestive juices on it, and suck it up.', 'Most snakes move by pushing the scales on the underside of their body against the ground. The body moves in a series of S shaped loops. Some large snakes, such as the boas, move in a straight line. They inch their body forward like a caterpillar does. Other snakes move by folding and unfolding like an accordion. Many desert snakes use a movement called sidewinding. They throw their body upward and sideways across the sand. Most snakes live alone for most of the year. Some kinds gather for mating or hibernation. Most snakes lay eggs, but others give birth to', 'The station would be underneath Wellington street. The opening of the new tramway along the embankment meant it was decided to link up with this route instead and the station was never built. A new sharp curve was built under Lancaster place to allow an exit through the western side wall of Waterloo bridge. A triangular junction with the through line was constructed. The eastern side of this junction, leading to Blackfriars, was removed as part of the 1930s upgrade. Through services started on 10 April 1908. They ran from Highbury station to Tower bridge and to Kennington gate. There', "We're being forced to learn how to drive all over again because of the high cost of gas and to make an effort to save at the pump. Buying gas is something we must do all too often, sometimes weekly to get us to work and other necessary destinations. It's not a bill that just comes around monthly such as utilities. It has become a constant strain on our cash flow. Perhaps the best lesson to be learned is to drive calmly, slow down and be patient. Drive as though there is a cup of hot coffee on your dashboard", 'It is the incredibly complex programming and powerful machines which have allowed computer games to provide such unpredictable gaming patterns, and therefore scope for a wide range of results. The subtleties of a video game are so hard to pick up on now, that when you do it is an incredibly satisfying feeling when you do perfect these techniques to improve your skill levels that much further. As it is for a gymnast when they finally land that front flip, it is great to be able to demonstrate your skill on a video game when you have finally overcome a', 'In fact, some researchers estimate there may be hundreds of millions. So scientists are searching for a clear explanation for why the squid are so similar but numerous. The public perception of giant squid is that they are rare. But the creatures seem rare only because they inhabit a different part of the planet than we do, Roper told Science News. Books like Moby Dick and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea have depicted these animals as sea monsters. And no wonder. Their eyes are larger than a human head. They use a parrot like beak to dismember their prey. And', 'Humans, apes, and monkeys use their arms to move their hands into positions to do many tasks. They use their arms and hands to push and pull objects, to fight and defend themselves, and to carry their young. Apes and monkeys also use their arms to swing on branches and to move around on the ground. Many other animals have two front limbs, but only primates have true arms. The two front limbs of other animals are known as legs, flippers, or wings. Both sea stars, or starfish, and octopuses have limbs that people sometimes call arms. But these arms', 'It takes practice at every level to gain the skill and confidence to proceed. Like anything worth accomplishing, pencil drawing gives great satisfaction as you spend the time to practice. Set aside some time every day to work on a certain technique. Only 15 or 20 minutes can move you along and you will find it relaxing and more fulfilling than staring at the television. As you move on to learn some basic principles used in various exercises and the techniques that rely on them to build strong illustration abilities, you will see how each principle applies when you really', "Ideally this should be done before the leaves start to turn to give you more prep time, but as with most things, it's better late than never. It's best to find 3 to 5 locations close to, or on the way to where you live or work. This approach gives you options and also allows you to quickly take advantage of ever changing light and weather conditions. Choose locations that have a variety of tree species. The contrasting colors combined with the proper light can provide a gorgeous setting. The times just after sunrise and early evening generally work best.", 'Galaxies are divided into three main categories based on their shapes: spiral, elliptical, and irregular. Spiral galaxies look like pinwheels. They have a central disk and two or more curved arms winding outward. The disk consists mainly of older stars, while the arms have younger stars. The arms contain much dust and gas, from which new stars can form. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy. An elliptical galaxy may be shaped like a round ball or may be more stretched out, like an American football. It has more stars near its center and fewer stars in its outer regions.', "After crossing Florida, it curved to the Northeast and entered the Atlantic Ocean. The storm probably died out on October 23. The storm was unusual because it was first thought to be two different hurricanes. This is because of the loop it made in the Gulf of Mexico. One paper reported that the first hurricane died in the central Gulf of Mexico; the second hurricane formed and hit Florida. The storm's path was debated, and it was later found to be a single cyclone. On October 9, a type of storm called a Tropical Depression began in the southern Caribbean", "One of the best early reading strategies is to help build your child's reading comprehension. You do this by reading a portion of their favorite story, and then asking them questions which will get them involved in the story. As your child begins to build their ability to answer more questions about the portion of text in question, read longer portions of the book before stopping. Gradually increase the amount you read before asking questions about the story, until you're able to read the entire book and your child can still recall the parts of the story which correlate to", "When deadly virus outbreaks occur, scientists want to know where the disease is coming from and how to stop it. In their search for answers, some will pay a visit to their local museum. They are not trying to take their minds off the outbreak. Instead, they come to sift through the museum's historic collections, looking for clues that might help them save lives. For instance there was an outbreak of hantavirus in New Mexico and nearby states. The sometimes deadly disease causes flu like symptoms and difficulty breathing. At the time, no one knew the source of the outbreak.", 'The global arms race in battleship construction beginning in the late 19th century and exacerbated by dreadnought was one of the causes of World War I, which saw a clash of large battle fleets at the Battle of Jutland. The Naval Treaties of the 1920s and 1930s limited the number of battleships but did not end the evolution of design. Both the allies and the axis powers deployed battleships of old construction and new during World War II. The value of the battleship has been questioned, even during the period of their prominence. In spite of the immense resources spent', 'In solid form, carbon dioxide is a useful substance called dry ice. Carbon dioxide becomes a solid at a very low temperature, so dry ice is very cold. But unlike ice made from water, dry ice does not melt. Instead, it goes straight from a solid to a gas. Dry ice may be used when shipping meat, ice cream, or other products that need to be kept cold. Carbon dioxide is useful in baking as well. Yeast, baking powder, and baking soda all release carbon dioxide gas when they are mixed into batter or dough. The gas forms bubbles, which', 'Training American bulldogs will require some dedication and patience but you will definitely find it all worth it. A well trained pet will be protective and loyal to your family. These dogs are very intelligent though they may be stubborn. They are very much capable of obeying and learning if you work with them consistently. The breed loves to please the owners so they will definitely do everything they can to please you and follow your commands once it has been trained. Fortunately, there are a lot of resources available today on training this breed and you may even ask', 'Biologist today have classified and divided all living things into five groups they call kingdoms. These kingdoms are based on how living things are the same and how they are different. It is important that you understand that biologists are still learning about our world, and are making new discoveries every single day. As our knowledge about the world around us improves, scientists might find a better way to organize and classify life. As a result, these five kingdoms may someday change. This would not be the first time that such a change has been made.', 'Seeing the demand, many companies began developing home electronic games. The quality of the games sound and images steadily improved. The technology used to run the games also improved. Nintendo was the first company to provide a keypad with its consoles rather than just a joystick. Game companies continue to add new features to their games. Some systems now let players play together over telephone lines. Electronic gaming has become one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world.', "Stress can be caused by a lot of things, from work issues to financial situations, but did you know that the foods you eat can also cause stress? Here are some foods that can cause stress when you eat too much of them. Caffeine is well known as a stimulant. When you're trying to relax, having a caffeine boost isn't the answer to your problem. You don't have to eradicate it forever, but try to limit your intake of caffeine if you're feeling the effects of stress in your life. Candy is another food item that has potential for causing", 'The hubble space telescope was launched by NASA in 1990. Hubble is the length of a large school bus and weighs as much as two adult elephants. Hubble travels around earth at about 5 miles per second. It takes pictures of planets, stars and galaxies. Hubble has seen the birth and death of stars. It has seen galaxies that are billions of light years away. Hubble has also seen comet pieces crash into the atmosphere above Jupiter. Hubble is named after the astronomer Edwin P. Hubble. He made important discoveries in the early 1900s. He found many galaxies in the', 'The NFL is an unincorporated 501 association, a federal nonprofit designation, comprising its 32 teams. The regular season is a seventeen week schedule during which each team plays sixteen games and has one bye week. The season currently starts on the Thursday night in the first full week of September and runs weekly to late December or early January. At the end of each regular season, six teams from each conference play in the NFL playoffs, a twelve team single elimination tournament that culminates with the championship game, known as the super bowl.', "The probe also discovered a hurricane like storm locked to the south pole that clearly showed an eyewall. Until this discovery, eyewalls had only been seen on earth. Saturn's interior is similar to Jupiter's interior. It has a small rocky core about the size of the earth at its centre. It is very hot; its temperature reaches 15,000K. Saturn is so hot that it gives out more heat energy into space than it receives from the sun. Above it is a thicker layer of metallic hydrogen, about 30,000 km deep. Above that layer is a region of liquid hydrogen and", "Cacti are succulent plants. This means that they have thick tissues that take up and hold large amounts of water. The stored water keeps them alive during dry periods. Unlike many plants, cacti do not have deep roots. Instead they have roots that spread out near the surface of the soil. This is important to their survival. These roots absorb water from a wide area during the few times it rains. Cacti are known for their pointy spines. These grow in different patterns on the plant's surface. Some cacti also have flowers and branches. Most do not have leaves. If", "Most of us have experienced what is called writer's block at some point. We will sit down to write, paint or make music only to find we can't get the creative juices flowing. Most frustrating of all, the more effort and thought we put into it, the harder it becomes. Now at least, neuroscientists who study the brain might have found a clue about why it is so difficult to force that creative spark. Researchers recently set out to explore the origins of creativity in the brain and came up with surprising findings. Their study suggests that the cerebellum, the", "The Cassini spacecraft is about to get an icy shower. This will happen as it orbits Saturn. Cassini will storm through a jet of water vapor and frozen particles. The water vapor and frozen particles erupt from the south pole of Enceladus. Enceladus is one of Saturn's many moons. The spacecraft will zoom within thirty miles of the pole. This will provide the best sampling yet of its underground ocean. Cassini will be traveling nineteen thousand mph. It should take just an instant to enter the plume. A global liquid ocean is thought to exist beneath Enceladus' frozen crust. Enceladus", "At Thingvellir national park you can see the boundary between the plates for yourself. It is a deep rift where the two plates pull apart. Stand on one side and look down into the rift. On the west side, you can stand on the North American plate. On the east side is the Eurasian plate. You're looking right between two tectonic plates. Each year, the plates move about an inch farther apart. As they move, the land stretches out to cover more area. In this way, Iceland is slowly growing bigger. Volcanoes don't usually pop up every day. It has", "Growing enormous, near perfect silicon crystals is one of the primary skills in modern computer chip manufacturing. These crystals are then sliced into thin wafers, then engraved, processed, and treated in sometimes hundreds of different ways before being diced into the individual die and packaged into commercial processors. It's possible to make superior transistors out of things like carbon, and even more exotic materials like germanium, but none of them allow the sort of bulk manufacturing silicon allows through large crystal growth.", 'Gold is found in rocks throughout the world. But in most cases the amount of gold is so small that it is not visible. It is therefore not easy to get it out of the rock. But gold is often found in rock that also has copper and lead. In the process of extracting these elements the gold is also extracted. In certain areas gold can be found in larger deposits. These occur where the surrounding rock has been worn or washed away over the years. The gold is sometimes washed into streams or rivers, where it can be seen.', 'Although thousands of earthquakes occur in the United States each year, most are too small to affect us. The stronger ground shaking generated in such events is unlikely to affect people directly, other than by startling or frightening them. It is what these ground motions can do to the natural and manmade environments around us that can significantly affect us by endangering our lives, property, and livelihoods. Intense ground shaking can generate many sources of potential harm or loss. In the natural environment, such hazards include landslides or avalanches, tsunamis, and flash floods.', 'Your blood now enters the left atrium of your heart. It is then pumped out to your body via your left ventricle. Your arteries carry blood from your heart out to the rest of your body. They have very thick walls which allow them to withstand the immense pressure created as your heart pumps blood forcefully. As blood travels outward, the arteries become smaller and smaller until eventually the blood enters into what are known as capillaries. Capillaries are so tiny that blood usually can only get through one cell at a time. It is within the capillaries that oxygen', 'The chairman of the highways committee held an opening ceremony. The first journey took 10 minutes to go to Aldwych and 12 minutes to get back. This was also allowing for the horse drawn vehicles that were using the roads on the overground part of the route. On the 16 November of the same year the routes were extended north from the Angel to Highbury station. The route used special trams built from materials that could not catch fire. Wooden trams, like those used on other routes, were not allowed to go through the subway. In the parliamentary session of', 'Coin collection is a hobby of people from all across the globe which deals with collecting and trading coins that are rare. Usually these coins have been in circulation for a brief period or in some cases are decades old. Every collector values his collection and takes utmost care to preserve it. There are several tools like collectors albums and coin books that help coin collectors to maintain their collection. In fact some collectors preserve their collection well and at a later stage trade the rare coins in exchange for a handsome amount in cash. Coin collection apart from being', 'The bacteria that bring about decay are the chief cause of food spoilage. For fresh foods, the decay process may be slowed down by refrigeration or checked by freezing. When frozen food is thawed, however, the bacteria become active again. Many kinds of bacteria can be killed by heat. Because few species grow in foods that are acidic, dried, salted, or very sweet, it is easier to process foods with these qualities. For example, canning acidic foods such as tomatoes is less complicated than processing green beans. The amount of heat required to can non acidic foods successfully is very', 'Remember that a map is a visual representation of a much larger area of land. In order to be useful, a map must by necessity be small enough to be handled by an individual. Imagine drawing a map of the earth that was full size. Of course this is ridiculous. A full size map of the earth would not only be too large to be useful, but it would also be impractical to make. Maps are scaled down so that they fit on the available paper or screen. When scaling down a map, every part of the map is scaled', 'During the early history of the Solar System, the asteroids melted to some degree, allowing elements within them to be partially or completely differentiated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive volcanism and formed magma oceans. However, because of the relatively small size of the bodies, the period of melting was necessarily brief compared to the much larger planets, and had generally ended about 4.5 billion years ago, in the first tens of millions of years of formation. In August 2007, a study of zircon crystals in an Antarctic meteorite believed to have', "Just because you don't need your appendix, does not mean it is useless. For a long time people thought it was. Charles Darwin thought the appendix was shriveled. He thought it was a leftover organ. He figured it was used by early humans to help digest leaves. That has been the main way of thinking until recently. That is the great thing about science. Sometimes everyone thinks one thing. And then someone else says I have a better explanation. A team of researchers did just that. They wondered if it is not so much what the appendix does, but what", "Big changes have been taking place on earth due to human activity. Not only that, the changes have started to speed up. One change has to do with global warming. Humans burn fuels to power cars and factories, which adds certain gases to the atmosphere. The gases cause the planet's temperature to rise. As the temperature rises, ice melts, the oceans will rise, and the earth's weather patterns will change. Overall, the effects of global warming could be enormous. Meanwhile, as the global population has grown and technology has advanced, humans have reshaped the land. For example, humans have now", 'Drifting has increased the danger and adrenaline of an already exciting sport; attracting a new audience of fans worldwide. Because of the demands of drift racing, it is often necessary to modify or build cars for the sole purpose of drifting. In Japan, many have taken a liking to certain car models whose overall weight, and engines powers are ideal for the sport. It is important to have the proper weight, height, tires and suspension on a drifting car in order to prevent injuries from turnovers or other accidents. In order to successfully drift, the driver must be entering extremely', "Your ab workout should start with core training. Whereas abdominal crunches only work your muscles in a single direction, core training involves the stabilizer muscles in both your back and abdominal area. A good core training program works on lots of different muscle groups: upper back, lower back, the butt muscles, hips, inner and outer thighs, and hamstrings. It targets muscles all up and down your abs and your back. With stronger muscles to help support the entire length of your spine and placing serious emphasis on posture, your body won't have to work as hard to maintain its proper", "Different groups or classes play different roles in a bee nest or colony. Three different castes make up the social structure of a bee colony and include the queen, workers and drones. It's the job of the worker bees to collect pollen and nectar for the family. To aid them in pollen collection, they have a special pollen basket, called the corbicula, on their hind legs. It is a small depression surrounded by long hairs which help them carry pollen back to the nest. Upon their return, the worker bees share what they've collected. The nectar is a source of", 'Unlike electromagnetic radiation, mechanical radiation cannot travel through empty space. It can travel only through a substance, such as air, water, or solid objects. A common example of mechanical radiation is sound. Sound is produced by the back and forth motion of a vibrating object. This motion produces sound waves that travel away from the object. Sound travels more slowly than light does. This is why during a storm, the sound of thunder follows a flash of lightning. An earthquake produces another form of mechanical radiation. The shock waves created by an earthquake travel through Earth and cause the ground', 'Like many other products, such as bologna and liver sausage, hot dogs and frankfurters are created by a meat emulsion, although meat batter might be a more accurate term. Higher quality products are made from top quality meats and no chemicals. Examples include kosher, all beef hot dogs that have no by products, fillers or artificial colors or flavors. Less expensive types of hot dogs will have chemicals, fats and water binding agents added. First pork and or beef trimmings are ground up in a machine and then extruded through a metal sieve like device so they resemble ground hamburger', 'Do away with the roof top luggage rack and save another 5% by reducing the air drag and weight. Make sure your trunk is empty too or the extra weight will add 2% to your gas bill for each 100 pounds. Small things add up quickly. Make sure they add up to your benefit. Perhaps when you were young and learning to drive your mom or dad instructed you to let the car engine idle and warm up for a few minutes before driving. This is not needed now. Late model cars are designed to be driven almost immediately with', "Beluga whales are instantly recognizable by their bright white skin and melon shaped heads. Adults can weigh over three thousand pounds. That might seem huge to you, but to put it into perspective, the blue whale, the world's largest whale, can weigh up to four hundred thousand pounds. When compared to other whales, it's easy to see that belugas are on the smaller side. Although they might be small, they still carry around a large amount of blubber on their bodies to keep warm in the chilly Arctic waters where they live. This blubber may account for up to forty", 'Yet, when they returned, they found that their calendars were off by one day with the calendars of everyone in their home countries. What happened? How did these men lose an entire day? The day was not lost all at once. It was lost little by little, as they traveled around the earth. If you stay in one place, a day lasts 24 hours. However, if you travel the opposite direction of the rotation of the earth, your day will be slightly longer than 24 hours, because you are traveling ahead of the setting sun. If you travel with the', 'Living things grow. When many cells in a plant or an animal divide, the plant or animal becomes larger. Making new parts is another kind of growth. Organisms also reproduce, or create new life. Animals have babies. Plants make seeds or spores that grow into new plants. Scientists divide living things into groups. This process is called classification. The groups are based on features shared by the members of each group. There are several levels of groups, and each group has a specific name. Classification allows scientists to describe living things in a precise way.', 'Toys that talk back are one of the hottest holiday gifts this year. Hackers may soon be going after these toys too, to steal information from children. People who study Internet security discovered that the system behind Hello Barbie is not secure. Hello Barbie is a talking doll that works by connecting to the Internet. The researchers reviewed the toy to see if it was safe for kids and they said that it was not safe when it connected to the Internet. Sending information online made it easy for hackers to get personal information about kids from the toy.

If you do, everything looks good and you'll find yourself straying from the list. You might want to have a small snack before you shop to curb any ravenous appetite. Compare the unit price and buy a larger size if it's less per ounce or per pound. You can always divide it up in smaller packages when you get home. Higher priced items are usually placed at eye level so look up or down for lower priced foods. More expensive items are also usually on the high traffic aisles so wander off the beaten", "Modern life depends on data that moves quickly over large distances, whether we're on mobile phones or online. But too much data can slow the flow. That's why engineers have been developing clever ways to deliver big data at fast speeds. And a new type of fiber optic cable may do just that. Fiber optic cables contain bundles of thin, flexible glass fibers that transmit light. Nothing travels faster than light. So companies that offer customers lightning fast access to the Internet use these cables to move data. Light has its limits, however. Like rush hour on a crowded highway,", "Cell division is important for plant growth. Cells divide throughout a tiny plant's system when it is still inside its seed. As soon as the developing plant forms a root tip, shoot tip, and tiny leaves, cell division is limited to certain areas of the plant. One area is at the root, where new cells cause roots to grow deeper into the soil. Another area where cells divide is near the shoot tip. New cells at the shoot tip allow for the growth of stems and leaves. New cells at these locations can continue to divide.", 'Have astronomers found a huge new world past Pluto? In the last twenty years, astronomers have identified about two thousand new worlds using a telescope in space. These planets orbit stars that lie tens or even hundreds of light years from Earth. These discoveries are important, but no single planet is likely to be much of a big deal. The new planet is a very different story. It does not circle a distant star. Instead, it is part of our own solar system, a place you would think we had explored pretty well by now. Evidently not. A new study', "Muscles make it possible for animals to move. Worms move by tightening and relaxing their muscles in waves. Snails and clams crawl with the help of a big muscle called a foot. Insects move their legs and wings with muscles hidden under their exoskeleton, or hard covering. Fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals move with the help of muscles connected to their skeleton. All the muscles in an animal's body make up its muscular system. There are three types of muscle. Muscle connected to a skeleton is called skeletal muscle. Animals with backbones, including humans, also have two other types of", 'Assuming the gamma ray explosion to be spherical, the energy output of GRB 080319B would be within a factor of two of the rest mass energy of the sun, the energy which would be released were the Sun to be converted entirely into radiation. Because of the immense distances of most gamma ray burst sources from earth, identification of the progenitors, the systems that produce these explosions, is particularly challenging. The association of some long GRBs with supernovae and the fact that their host galaxies are rapidly star forming offer very strong evidence that long gamma ray bursts are associated', "An increasing number of people are wanting to do their part to save the planet due to the worsening problems caused by global warming. Unfortunately, people assume that going green is costly and time consuming, but it's not. Recycling is an easy way to start. A lot of people continue to place glass and aluminum items in their normal garbage but it's not hard to locate a trash service that offers glass and aluminum recycling choices. It merely takes a few minutes to wash off the cans and bottles before placing them into the recycle bin. Newspapers are another item", "One concern many parents have is teaching their baby to walk. It may seem like it just comes naturally, and to an extent it does. However, there are things you can do to prepare your baby to walk. Babies don't just wake up one day and start walking. There's a natural progression from rolling over, to sitting up, to crawling, to pulling up to walking. Teaching your baby to walk easily depends on her mastering those first steps. When your baby starts to become mobile, it's important to make sure that your home is a safe environment. Toys that allow", 'A calendar is a tool used to mark the passing of time. People of ancient times based their calendars on the most obvious regular events they knew the changing positions of the sun, moon, and stars. These calendars helped them figure out when to plant and harvest their crops. Over time different groups of people developed other calendars based on their own needs and beliefs. Several units of time are common to almost all calendars. The day is the most basic unit. The day measures the cycle of daytime and nighttime. It is now known to be the length of', 'During the 1920s the LCC also realized that for the subway to remain profitable it would need to be able to take double deck trams. In 1929, it was then decided that the headroom of the tunnel would be increased to 16 feet 6 inches. This would be done by raising the roof or deepening the tunnel as appropriate. Work started on 11 September 1929. The work resulted in the replacement of the cast iron tubes with a new steel girder supported roof. The sewer was also diverted. In some places the trackbed was lowered by 5 feet. This meant', 'You can see why scientists no longer classify living things into two kingdoms. Biologists believe that ancient protists were the ancestors of plants and animals. The Fungi kingdom is made up of a variety of different fungi. For many years, it was believed that fungi were plants. Today we know that fungi are different from plants in some very important ways. First, unlike plants, fungi cannot make their own food. They must rely on other food sources to support them. There are also differences in the basic makeup and chemistry of their cells. One common type of fungus is the', "Going to the stars is often regarded as the future of human travel. Scientists wrote that humans will eventually travel to and inhabit space beyond Earth. Earth is humanity's cradle, but you're not meant to stay in your cradle forever. However, in the century since this vision was proposed, we have learned things about the universe and ourselves. The things suggest moving out into space may not be our future after all. A big problem is the size of the universe. Its size was not known when people first imagined we would go to the stars. For example one of", 'Mixing the metals copper and zinc together makes brass. Such a mixture of metals is called an alloy. Brass is often used to make tools and machine parts. Sculptors and other artists use brass because it is easy to shape. Brass doorknobs, faucets, and towel racks are found in many homes. Brass is also used to make such musical instruments as trombones, trumpets, French horns, and tubas. Brass is made by heating copper to a very high temperature. Then workers add small amounts of heated zinc to the copper. The zinc melts into the copper and forms brass. Workers may', 'Film is a thin, see through material. It has a special coating that goes through chemical changes when light comes into the camera from the outside. These changes create the image. After taking pictures, the photographer takes the film out of the camera. Then the photographer treats the film with more chemicals. This process is called developing. It creates a photographic negative. On a negative, dark areas of the image are light and light areas are dark. Photographers create prints, or photographs, by passing light through the negative onto special paper. One negative can make many prints.', "When you're on the highway, use cruise control, which helps maintain a constant speed. Use the highest gear possible and overdrive gears if you have them. The faster an engine is turning, the more gas you're using. Pay attention to your tachometer. Plus, a slower turning engine means less friction and engine wear. Avoid excessive idling. Idling gets zero miles per gallon. It doesn't get much worse than that. If you're stopped for a train or backed up in a fast food take out line or waiting for a drive thru bank teller, stop your engine if you're going to", "A cough is a sudden burst of air out of a person's lungs. Coughs happen when something irritates, or bothers, the respiratory system. The respiratory system is the group of organs that allows people to breathe. Materials that cause a cough come from various places. Smoke, dust, chemicals, and pollution in the air all can trigger a cough. Illnesses such as colds, influenza, and pneumonia also can cause a cough. These illnesses cause parts of the respiratory system to make more of a thick, sticky fluid called mucus. The mucus builds up and makes it harder to breathe. Coughing brings", 'Several groups of bacteria can form structures called endospores, or spores. The spore is a resting stage that enables the organism to endure adverse conditions. When conditions improve, the spores transform into active bacteria. Some spores, such as those that cause the diseases anthrax, botulism, and tetanus, can withstand extremely harsh conditions, including boiling water, extreme cold, and exposure to many chemical disinfectants, over long periods of time. Some bacteria exchange genetic material before undergoing fission. In these species, a tubelike structure extends between two bacterial cells.', 'Electricity is the flow of tiny particles called electrons and protons. It can also mean the energy you get when electrons flow from place to place. Electricity can be seen in nature in a bolt of lightning. Lightning is nothing but a large number of electrons flowing through air all at once, releasing a huge amount of energy. Scientists have also learned how to generate, or create, electricity. This is useful because electricity that is generated can be controlled and sent through wires. It can then power such things as heaters, lightbulbs, and computers. Today electricity provides most of the', 'Many styles of cars have arisen from the sport drifting. The media of course has shown the more elegant side of drifting, featuring cars with millions of dollars invested in them. All equipped with the best engines and tires for safety, and we cannot forget the best paint jobs for appeal. On the other hand, drifting has been made more affordable by various styles of cars such as bosozoku cars. Sometimes used only for visual appeal, bosozoku cars are extremely radically designed often having protruding body kits for extra appeal. Drifting has become an apparent hobby and even lifestyle for', 'Our bodies are made up of a variety of very large and very small muscles. From the powerful leg muscles that you use when you jump up and down to the tiny muscles that make your eyes blink, anytime you move, you are using muscles. In fact, as you type this article you are using muscles to move your hands and eyes. Scientists have estimated that about 40%, or almost half, of your body is muscle. There are three different types of muscles within your body. Each muscle type is different because it has a different type of job to', 'Science also suggests that women have more empathy than men do. Scientists connect more empathy to more contagious yawning. They say that if women are more empathic than men, then they must catch more yawns, too. To find out, the Italian scientists took a closer look. They observed people at work, eating dinner and at other places. Over five years, they recorded almost fifteen hundred cases of yawning. The scientists watched ninety two pairs of people who passed a yawn at least three times.', "Understanding what types of activities and scheduling conflicts are preventing a child from obtaining a sufficient amount of physical activity and fitness can be a good way for parents to begin to understand how and where transformations can be made regarding kids' health. Tracking the amount of activity a child partakes can be as simple as gaining an awareness of their school schedules and whether they include physical education classes, recess and other ways children participate in fitness centered activities. Children who participate in a variety of physically demanding activities at school, such as extracurricular athletics or PE classes may", "A burning smell can be a warning sign of many things, including your transmission. A burning odor coming from your transmission fluid means the fluid has broken down. When this happens, corrosive agents and varnish accumulate throughout the transmission. When this happens, heat builds up and can ultimately cause complete transmission failure. Transmission overheating can be disastrous, so if you ever smell any kind of burning odor, stop driving immediately until you have your vehicle checked out by a professional. Many repair shops will offer free towing with repair if you're within a certain distance from their location.", 'Drifting is a style of car racing, local to Japan, where the racer intentionally loses traction of the car in order to maintain a high speed during a turn. The car continues traveling forward at high speeds, and ideally will be facing the correct direction at the end of the turn. Drift racing is extremely dangerous due to the lack of control during a turn, which can easily result in a crash, or flipping of a vehicle. Drifting is also very crippling to the tires of a car, causing the need to be replaced regularly with excessive misuse. In addition', 'The sport of mountain biking is one of the best active sports you can do for a number of fitness reasons and depending on what style of mountain biking you partake in, it can also be a great deal of fun and will keep you fit at the same time. People are usually unaware of how many muscles you use when riding a mountain bike, and how quickly you can burn calories as it can be an extremely good work out for the body. If you plan on riding cross country along different styles of trails, riding a bike can', "This game is held at a preselected site which is usually a city that hosts an NFL team. The NFL is the most attended domestic sports league in the world by average attendance per game, with 66,960 fans per game in 2010-11. Although not as frequently as the other major professional sports leagues in the United States, the NFL still is not immune to labor disputes, such as the player's strikes of 1982 and 1987, and more recently a lockout in 2011, though the latest did not result in the cancellation of any regular season games. The standard season started", 'These elements are mixed in numerous combinations to form prescribed workouts of the day or wods. Hour long classes at affiliated gyms, or boxes, typically include a warm up, a skill development segment, the high intensity wod, and a period of individual or group stretching. Performance on each wod is often scored or ranked to encourage competition and to track individual progress. Some affiliates offer additional classes, such as olympic weightlifting, which are not centered around a wod. CrossFit programming is used by 5000 private affiliated gyms and by many fire departments, law enforcement agencies, and military organizations.', 'Colors are mixed on the wet paper, better shading results than from premixing colors. The paint is stiff and must be worked to remove lumps. If it becomes sticky or dry, a few drops of water may be sprinkled on it until it has an easy, sliding consistency. If liquid starch and tempera are used, the artist pours one teaspoon of starch on the paper. Then one half teaspoon of the dry tempera is added, and the mixture is worked evenly across the paper. When a painting is finished, it is placed flat on a newspaper to dry and finally', 'In order to solve this problem it was decided to leave out the leap year three times every 400 years. So, the new rule was, a century year, 1600, 1700, etc. would only be a leap year if it was evenly divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, but 2100 will not be. The Egyptians were the first people to think of adding a leap day to the calendar every four years. Later, the Romans copied the idea. Other nations have different calendars and different methods of keeping the calendar in line with the', "As the number of overweight children in the United States continues to climb, fitness is a consideration that weighs heavily on the minds of parents, caregivers and teachers. The risk of health issues accompanying obesity among children provokes many fears that unless parents and children make significant changes in the lifestyles inhabited by our kids, diabetes, heart disease, and other weight related conditions have the potential to run rampant among American youth. Although encouraging a healthy lifestyle, among children, that includes physical activity and fitness is vital to addressing issues associated with health problems and obesity, the addition of kid's", "Where there's water, animals can't be far behind. Water helps animals take in nutrients and get rid of waste. It helps them keep cool on hot days. If water is hard to find, animals must conserve water. A camel can go without drinking water for a long time, sometimes as long as six months. It also saves water by not sweating. A camel can change its body temperature during the hottest part of the day. This keeps it from overheating. Because it does not need to sweat to cool itself down, it saves water. Camels are not the only animals", 'Grasses are a family of plants with leaves that usually look like blades. Most of them also have hollow stems and many branching roots. The green grass found in yards, the grasses growing on open land, grains, and bamboos all belong to the grass family. Grasses grow almost everywhere on Earth because they can survive in many different climates. Large areas of wild grass are called grasslands. The different types of grasslands include prairies, steppes, savannas, and pampas.', "Death Valley deserves its name. It is a sunburnt land of salt flats, bad water, and scorching sand. This parched place is the hottest, driest spot in North America. However, it has not always been a desert. It was once a lake. The climate was much wetter. The land nearby was rich with life. The valley was still a lake when the first Native Americans arrived about 10,000 years ago. About 1000 years ago, the ancestors of today's Timbisha Shoshone people came to the valley. Over time, the climate changed. Temperatures rose. Less rain fell. The lake dried up. Only", 'Transmissions require fluid in order to function and are the lifeblood of the transmission, serving to keep the internal parts cool and lubricated. One warning sign of a bad transmission is when your vehicle begins to leak transmission fluid. If you park on a white surface, such as a concrete driveway or in a garage, you will be able to tell if you have such fluid leakage. If you notice any pinkish fluid leaking out, then you will know that it is from the transmission. Also any very dark or burned looking fluid is another sign that the transmission may', "The mountains of Japan's Yamagata prefecture are considered sacred by the Buddhists in the region. These holy sites are sparsely populated, their forests interrupted only occasionally by isolated Buddhist temples. Many of the men serving in the temples come seeking solitude and an escape from the modern world. They were probably a bit startled, then, when a group of scientists and historians showed up and asked to see their mummies. The year before, several researchers investigating rumors of local mummies had discovered six mummified Buddhist monks in five temples in Yamagata prefecture. Soon after the discovery, several Japanese universities formed", "Make the moon look extra cool by photographing it behind an object near the horizon. Buildings, statues, trees, and hills can all make great foreground subjects. You could also silhouette a person, animal, bicycle, or an airplane flying by. Of course, you'll need to find out what time and in which direction the moon will be rising so you can position yourself and your camera in a good spot. Check the weather forecast! If it's cloudy, you might still be able to capture a cool pic of the moon poking through the clouds. But if the weather's really bad, you", 'Electronic games are games run by computer technology. They are also called video games. People play electronic games on personal computers, in video arcades, and on home electronic game systems. The home systems are called consoles. Console games are played using a handheld device usually connected to a television. People may play electronic games alone or with others. All electronic games begin as computer instructions called software. A computer programmer writes the software commands to make the game run. The game software is then loaded onto hardware, a computer or a console. Inside the computer or the console, hardware and', "When the eyeball is too long from front to back, a person cannot see faraway objects clearly. This condition is called nearsightedness. Similarly, farsighted people have trouble seeing nearby objects. Their eyeballs are too short. Glasses, contact lenses, or surgery can correct these problems. Blindness happens when the eye's lens becomes cloudy or when the retina is damaged. Vertebrates, or animals with a backbone, each have two eyes similar to human eyes. But there are differences, which depend on the animal's habitat and behavior. For example, the pupils of animals active at night are often shaped like slits. This allows", 'Uncertain what had happened but not considering the matter particularly urgent, the team at the Los Alamos scientific laboratory, led by Ray Klebesadel, filed the data away for investigation. As additional vela satellites were launched with better instruments, the Los Alamos team continued to find inexplicable gamma ray bursts in their data. By analyzing the different arrival times of the bursts as detected by different satellites, the team was able to determine rough estimates for the sky positions of sixteen bursts and definitively rule out a terrestrial or solar origin.', 'Dead seabirds and starving sea lion pups are washing up on California beaches. Scientists are blaming it on the blob. But where the blob comes from and what will happen next is another story. The blob is a five hundred mile wide, three hundred feet deep mass of unusually warm seawater. It began spreading along the Pacific Coast a year ago. Scientists disagree over exactly what the blob means. Some experts predict the blob could bring huge rains to Southern California this winter. They also say it could make temperatures rise faster around the world than they already are. Not', "Polar bears are the top predator in the arctic marine ecosystem and the largest land carnivore. The polar bear's coat is perfectly adapted to its arctic environment. Along with a thick layer of body fat, the water repellent coat insulates the bear from cold air and water. It also serves as camouflage. Polar bears are excellent swimmers and can sustain a pace of 10 kph. Adult males can measure up to 10 feet long and weigh up to 1500 lbs. They spend much of their time at or near the edge of the pack ice. This is where they are", "For people who have experienced the effects of this condition, they would say that it's no laughing matter and that it can be difficult to deal with and may even result in a more serious concern like depression. Without getting enough sleep, you begin to deteriorate physically and mentally. If you notice a pattern of sleeplessness, you need to seek relief from the condition so that you can be at your best. While it's true that everyone loses sleep now and then, those with insomnia have repeated or prolonged incidents where they don't get the sleep they need.", "Space junk also threatens earth. On average, one piece of junk falls back to earth each day. Friction with particles in earth's atmosphere causes most of this stuff to burn up in the air. Big pieces slam into the ground or splash into the oceans. Luckily, only one person has been hit by falling space junk. She was not hurt. To protect astronauts and valuable satellites, scientists track space junk. By using radar and telescopes, they can track pieces of trash larger than a grapefruit. This allows scientists to keep tabs on 19,000 pieces of junk. This is only the", "Chlorophyll is used in photosynthesis, a process by which plants capture the sun's energy and combine it with carbon dioxide and water to make food. Oxygen is produced as a result of photosynthesis. The part of the algae that contains chlorophyll is a jelly bean shaped structure known as a chloroplast. Most sea slugs digest the chloroplasts right away. However, some species store them for weeks to months in large transparent digestive glands, turning the animals bright green. For many years, scientists have thought the slugs store chloroplasts in order to become solar powered combinations of animal and plant. The", 'Some cells divide to repair lost or damaged parts. This is called regeneration. Often the new growth does not look like the original, but it performs the role it is supposed to. For example, when a deep cut on human skin closes with new skin growth, it may leave a scar. Similarly, a tree trunk that is burned will produce a new covering, though the bark may be scarred. Some animals are able to regenerate missing parts. A lizard that loses its tail can grow a new one. A salamander can regrow a missing leg or eye. The human liver', "But very tiny surface bumps also afford each leaf physical protection. The closely spaced bumps are far smaller than the width of most water droplets. Together, these bumps hold water droplets above a leaf's surface, so that raindrops just bead up on top of them. You might picture this as something like a person resting on a bed of tightly spaced nails. Researchers are now surpassing nature by developing oil repellent surfaces. Some also have created surfaces that repel oil but attract water. The latter example would be useful in collecting the oil that forms slicks on the ocean's surface", "On earth, we can see one sunrise and one sunset each day. This is caused by earth's rotation, or spinning on its axis. It takes 24 hours for earth to complete one rotation about its axis relative to the Sun. From earth, the sun is the brightest object in the sky. It is also the largest object in our solar system. One million planets the size of earth could fit inside it. Yet the sun is just an average star. Stars are giant balls of hot gases. These gases are a star's fuel. Stars like our sun change their fuel", 'Lava is hot, liquefied rock that flows from a volcano or other opening in the surface of Earth. When the liquid rock is still underground it is known as magma. Igneous rock is formed when lava cools and hardens. Lava contains gas as well as rock. Sometimes the gases are released slowly or trapped as bubbles when the lava hardens. When the bubbles are tiny and closely packed, a lightweight stone called pumice is formed. Lava flows are classified according to their appearance and characteristics. Generally the higher the amount of silica, the thicker and slower moving the lava is.', 'Chocolate begins with the seeds of the cacao tree. The seeds form in long, cucumber shaped fruits called pods. When the pods are ripe, workers cut them from the tree and remove the seeds. The seeds sit for several days before being dried, either by the sun or in an oven. The dry seeds, called cocoa beans, are then shipped to processing plants or chocolate factories. At the plant or factory, workers roast the beans in giant ovens to bring out their flavor. Machines then remove the hard skin surrounding the beans. Next, machines grind the beans into a paste,', 'There are various parks in the United States that are designed for skating. Known as skate parks, each of these parks are designed in a similar manner but offer potentially unique and different skating experience. If you are planning a visit to one of these skate parks, always remember to check a few details. First of all determine the kind of skate park you are going to visit. Depending on whether the park is meant for street skating, vertical skating, or both, you need to choose your skating board and protective gears. If the park is for vertical skating, then', "Life is not fair. That is something that children seem to understand at a young age. However, how children develop a sense of what is fair and what is unfair, and how they act on that sense, has been a puzzle for scientists. A team of scientists recently traveled to seven countries to study how children understand fairness. They wanted to know how much of a child's sense of what is fair is natural and how much is learned. To do this, the scientists created an experiment to study how children responded to two types of unfair situations.", 'A large number of dog owners who have stubborn pets tend to take help from professional trainers to retrain even adult dogs for breaking habits. They can train your pet to teach it about your position as the master if you are dealing with a stubborn puppy. You may not even be aware that you are being submissive instead of dominating to the pet. These dogs will respond well to an environment where there are other dogs learning. Another important aspect of training American bulldogs is socializing them. These dogs will need to be socialized from an early age so', "Bacteria do not always live in groups. Individuals may swim inside your mouth or some other moist environment. On its own, a germ is like a person hiking alone through the woods. The hiker has to carry or catch her own food and scout for danger. But most bacteria, like most people, prefer the social life. Humans tend to live in communities. Many germs similarly settle into united groups of species. Bacteria normally live as part of a community. With their friends, they do much better. Of course, cities of bacteria can't erect actual buildings. Instead, they extend little hairs", 'Gum base gives gum that bounce back texture that makes it fun to chew. Each company keeps their special recipe for gum base a secret, but there is something we can tell you. All gum bases are made of three kinds of ingredients which give gum its special properties, resin is the main part you chew, wax softens the gum and elastomer adds flexibility. Companies that manufacture gum have chemists working in laboratories to make gum better. One idea is to trap the sweetener and flavoring in the gum so that the flavor gets released more slowly. This makes the', 'There is good news for coffee lovers from the American Heart Association. Their new report says coffee drinkers may live longer than those who do not drink coffee. Evidence shows that coffee makes you live longer. It also reduces the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, other life threatening illnesses, and even suicide. Researchers looked at who drank between one and five cups of coffee a day. Moderate consumption of coffee may confer health benefits in terms of reducing premature death due to several diseases. Scientists have been analyzing what is in coffee that provides so many health benefits.', 'Every year billions of bottles of wine, cooking oil, and other liquids are sealed with corks. Corks are made from the bark of a type of oak tree called the cork oak. The tree grows near the Mediterranean Sea. The cork oak usually grows to be about sixty feet tall. Its wide spreading branches give it a shape like an umbrella. Its narrow leaves are dark green and glossy. The bark of the cork oak grows in two layers. The thick outer layer is the cork. Tiny bubbles of air trapped between the cells of the cork make it spongy.', "If you're one of the almost ten million people who fall victim to identity theft one of the keys in getting the situation resolved satisfactorily is to report it immediately. The problem here is that you may not be aware of the theft until you apply for credit and are turned down, yet you know you've always paid your bills timely. Or, a gruff bill collector informs you he's about to repossess your car unless you pay up today. You try to explain that you've not bought a new car. Different types of identity thefts require notification to different authorities.", 'If a business has idle resources, there is room to make or save money using bartering. By thinking outside of the box, businesses can start to get their revenue figures back on track. Idle resources could be anything; it really depends on the business. A web design firm may be paying staff 8 hours a day, but only have enough work for 6 hours a day. A camping wholesaler may have gone a bit crazy with the whole economies of scale approach and been left with 1,000 extra sleeping bags; items they might never sell. Using the barter system, they', 'The disease has killed millions of bats. And the disease is spreading. Less than a handful of bat species are well understood. They are very difficult to study. In the last ten to twenty years, we are getting better and better technology. It allows us to learn about bats. Acoustic monitoring of bats is one example. At one time it meant carrying equipment on a vehicle. Now a device can be hooked up to cell phone. Scientists are also trying to perfect software that can identify the species of bat making the sound. The plan set out the first strategy.', "Another way in which the video game can allow for excellent levels of expression for the user, is that it can delve into the realms of fantasy. Of course, games don't have to be realistic, which means all forms of unthinkable things can be achieved. Where else can you summon dragons, leap at lightning speed from building to building, or transform yourself into beast form? Certainly not in real life, which gives video gaming even greater scope for the expression of imaginative, creative ideas. Probably the greatest advancement for video game players in terms of expression, though, must be the", "It's also a good idea to teach your child how to follow along with the words by placing your finger under each word as you read it. However, when doing this, it's important that you take the time to sound out each word as you read; otherwise your child may learn to read by memorization only. Another important thing to remember if you want to raise an early reader is to be consistent. Reading to your child once in awhile, or sounding out words on an infrequent basis won't give them the foundation they need to become early readers.

To experience the fun of white water rafting to an extreme one should always be careful of the obstacles that they have to face. The gear needs to be checked properly before the start of the ride and instructions need to be followed at all times. Some camps organize special hydrology sessions before the trip in order to understand the practicality and physics of white water rafting. Activities for children go up to rafting in', "Things were already looking bad for trees. The emerald ash borer, a tiny, glitter green insect from China, is expected to kill nearly all ash trees in the eastern United States, unless they are treated with expensive chemicals. Now, there is more disturbing news. The borer may have found a new target. The borer had attacked the white fringe tree, which is in the same family as not only the ash, but forsythia and lilac. Experts don't know quite what to make of the find yet, other than that it is worrisome. Will the half inch insect be a major", 'All such searches were unsuccessful, and in a few cases particularly well localized bursts, those whose positions were determined with what was then a high degree of accuracy, could be clearly shown to have no bright objects of any nature consistent with the position derived from the detecting satellites. This suggested an origin of either very faint stars or extremely distant galaxies. Even the most accurate positions contained numerous faint stars and galaxies, and it was widely agreed that final resolution of the origins of cosmic gamma ray bursts would require both new satellites and faster communication.', "The formula one group is the legal holder of the commercial rights. With annual spending totaling billions of US dollars, formula one's economic effect is significant, and its financial and political battles are widely reported. Its high profile and popularity make it a merchandising environment, which results in great investments from sponsors and budgets in the hundreds of millions for the constructors. However, mostly since 2000, due to the always increasing expenditures, several teams, including works teams from car makers and those teams with minimal support from the automotive industry, have become bankrupt or been bought out by companies wanting", "A new report warns that people could be in danger from superbugs if they eat rare and undercooked meat. The report is called the review on antimicrobial resistance. Researchers looked into how antibiotics in food are making bugs stronger. The report said the use of antibiotics in agriculture is making bugs stronger and more resistant to our medicines. The researchers said the huge amount of antibiotics in farming could be dangerous to people's health around the world. They suggested that farmers reduce the amount of antibiotics they give to their animals. The leader of the research said this was important", 'The most common ways to form sculpture are carving, modeling, casting, and constructing. Carving is the process of turning such substances as stone, wood, or ivory into a desired shape by cutting or chipping away pieces. Modeling involves shaping a soft material such as clay by hand. It can then be baked until it hardens. Models can also be used in casting. Casting is used to reproduce a piece of sculpture through the use of a mold. In one version a plaster mold is made around a model. When the mold has hardened, it is split apart and taken off', 'Worms are found almost all over the world. Some worms, such as earthworms, live in the ground. They help to improve the soil. Many worms are parasites. Parasites live inside other plants and animals, including humans, and can cause harm.

It is always recommended to never take on a river rafting trip that is too advanced for your abilities, always choose one appropriate for', 'Many ecologists do work in natural, outdoor settings. They look at all the different factors that affect ecosystems, or communities of living things. Studies in the outdoors are useful because they show what is actually happening in the environment. Ecology is important because it shows how changes in the environment affect the survival of living things. For example, when pollution kills certain living things, the animals that feed on them also may die. The work of ecologists has convinced many people to protect the environment and all the ecosystems that it supports.', 'Not all scholarships that are sports related come from athletes being recruited. In many cases, if you are looking for a sports scholarship, for whatever sport you happen to play, you might just have to ask. With so many high school athletes, it is conceivable that your talents at a given sport are head and shoulders above most people; but there is still the possibility you will be overlooked.

In fact, four leaders of the Fujiwara tribe had been mummified in the twelfth century and were still kept in a great golden temple hall in northeastern Japan. But mummification is a tricky business, especially in a climate so humid as. The researchers hoped to examine the temple mummies to uncover the details of this specific mummification process. To prevent bacteria, insects, and fungi from decomposing the mummy, the mummifier usually begins by extracting the internal organs to remove the most tempting food sources for the critters of decay. So when the researchers', "Vegetable gardening requires a lot more work than herb gardening. In fact, vegetable gardening can be one of the most time consuming types of gardening. Many vegetables require watering and fertilizing at regular intervals, and may require a lot of different types of maintenance. Some vegetables are hardier and less picky than others. You can find some types of vegetables that don't require a lot of work at all. So you can still find vegetable gardening a fun and relaxing hobby if you're careful to choose varieties that don't require constant attention. Some people may especially enjoy vegetable gardening because", "This trip involves white water rapids that intermittently disrupt the calm flow of the water, and allow people to capture both beauty and excitement. One of the nation's most popular white water rafting trips travels through the royal gorge. This adventure is an intermediate to advanced trip that attracts people from all over. Royal gorge rafting entails large rapids that can be too difficult for the inexperienced, which is why it is such a thrill for many. On top of these exciting rapids, this trip allows a person to float under the largest suspension bridge in the world, showing off", 'Travelers and phone camera lovers need to note a new danger that has recently come to light. This new life threatening hazard has sprung up in the past few years and is now a ubiquitous part of life. It is also proving to be twice as lethal as being killed by a shark. What is this potential new menace? Well, it is the selfie. Yes, love them or hate them, the desire to take a photo of yourself in front of a world famous site or to strike a pose and pout with a friend has resulted in more deaths', "The idea that the secret formula for Coca-Cola is only known by two people who are never to be allowed near one another in case of some disaster resulting in the recipe being lost forever is one of those pop culture staples people can't help but continue. Given this it's not surprising that the spread of this idea has also been helped by various advertising campaigns done by the company claiming just this. In fact, this idea actually started as a result of one of their advertisements.

Pets can help alleviate stress. Pets can also entertain you whenever you need a lift in your mood. Young pets are very playful and they thrive on the attention you give them, helping take your mind off of your own troubles. Even if you do nothing other than let your pet sit in your lap while you pet it, you'll be reaping many health rewards. Petting an animal reduces your blood pressure, and it's great for those suffering from arthritis", 'People have always been interested in animals. Very early in the history of civilization hunters tracked down and domesticated the animals of their own surroundings. These remote peoples also listened eagerly to travelers from far places who told of strange beasts they had seen and even stranger ones they had only heard about. Because early writers lacked scientific knowledge, they often confused fact with hearsay. Several books of travel and natural history that were dated from the middle ages were widely read, and their reports of fantastic animals were accepted. New versions, even more bizarre, were handed down.', 'It is not a passing trend; this is a fundamental shift that affects every area of our lives. And it is just the beginning. This rapid ongoing transformation is ultimately a good one, for those who embrace it and are willing to adapt. We are enjoying the benefits but mostly still underestimate the impact it will have, both in business and on our lives. The music industry was one of the first casualties of a failure to adapt. The digital world changed the way we acquire, store and enjoy music, and the established corporations resisted as hard as they could.', 'The technique of finger painting consists of spreading masses of paint with sweeping movements of the hands, fingers, and arms. The artist should stand up to work because the arms can move more freely than from a sitting position. A variety of movements gives the most interesting results. The paint is nonpoisonous and harmless to the skin and clothing. It washes off easily, feels like mud to the touch, spreads smoothly, and does not dry too quickly. It will not fade when dry. Various kinds of finger paints are available. One consists of liquid starch mixed with dry tempera or', "A teenager wearing a white leotard emblazoned with a big blue star pauses at the end of the balance beam.

She cartwheels to the far end of the beam and springs into the air. She spins, lands squarely on her feet and raises her arms in triumph. The stadium fills with cheers. A great performance followed by a great landing. It was just the thing to win the", "The world's population is ever rising. And the more people there are, the more need there is for clean drinking water. Now, researchers have come up with a new way to remove many pollutants from water, including salt: They zap it. The oceans hold about ninety percent of Earth's water. Its salt content makes it undrinkable. Other water that is pumped from underground often has minerals dissolved in it. So this water, too, can be undrinkable. Scientists have developed many methods to remove impurities from water. But those methods often take lots of energy. And that makes them costly.

A bored cat can create just as much havoc around your home as an unsupervised toddler, maybe even more. In fact, strange behavior in your cat is often a sign that he's trying desperately to get you involved in his world. How do you entertain a cat? First you start spending time with your cat on a regular basis and see what amuses him. Spending time isn't the same as simply being in the same room, arriving home, getting on", "House hunting bacteria won't just settle anywhere. They scout for good spots, such as the inside of your mouth. Teeth and gums provide solid surfaces on which they can build. And food flows to them every time you eat or drink. They grab some of the sugar or nutrients as they come by and it helps them grow. Sugary soft drinks and chocolate bars are among their favorite treats!

Many skate parks are privately held whereas many others are combined with city parks", "When the sweet spot finder finishes spinning the ball and evaluating its size and measurements, it positions the ball so that you can take a permanent marker and place a dot where the sweet spot is, right where the gadget tells you to. Most of these sweet spot finders take about 20 seconds to determine the sweet spot of a ball. And once it's marked, you can simply tee up with the dotted area ready for impact with your swing. Every ball has its own unique measurements, and although they're invisible to the naked eye, they're there, and they can", 'The publishing industry is going through a similar transformation with the rise of ebook readers like the Kindle and the iPad. These devices are brand new and they are already shaking the industry; who knows what will be available just one decade from now? Analysts predict the collapse of the traditional publishing model within 2 to 5 years. The general effect of the internet change is one of empowering individuals.

Since the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger, the FIA has used safety as a reason to impose rule changes which otherwise, under the concorde agreement, would have had to be agreed upon by all the teams, most notably the changes introduced for 1998. This so called narrow track era resulted in cars with smaller rear tires, a narrower', "When it comes to spiders, people generally know two facts about them, that you swallow around eight of them per year and that their blood is bright blue. Fortunately, the former is absolutely not true at all, the latter, on the other hand, is mostly correct. While it's certainly true that spiders have blue liquid in their veins, the reality is a bit more grounded than is sometimes depicted, with the fluid a much more reserved shade of blueish green. Also, thanks to fact that spiders are, generally, so tiny and contain very little liquid, you're not going to see", "To investigate, researchers taught a game to two macaques, a type of monkey. One monkey could press a yellow or green button while the other watched. If the first monkey pressed the right button, the team gave both animals a treat. Every couple of rounds, the two monkeys switched roles. Meanwhile, the scientists monitored individual cells in the animals brains. When the first monkey flubbed the game by pressing the wrong button, a group of cells in the medial frontal cortex of the second monkey's brain fired. But if the second monkey also made the wrong choice during its turn,", "The ship's shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only one meter deep and permitted beach landings, while its light weight enabled it to be carried over portages. Longships were also double ended, the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without having to turn around; this trait proved particularly useful in northern latitudes where icebergs and sea ice posed hazards to navigation. Longships were fitted with oars along almost the entire length of the boat itself.

The more you read to your child, the more words she will begin to understand, and the more of an interest she will take in the reading process. Every parent wants the best start for their children in this life. This is also true for the start we give them when it comes to reading. Studies have proven that children who learn to read at an earlier age have an easier time in school, and are twice as likely to complete levels of higher', 'But, within less than a year and a half after his return from London, the aged statesman set sail once again for Europe, beginning a career as diplomat that would occupy him for most of the rest of his life. In the years 1776-79, as one of three commissioners, he directed the negotiations that led to treaties of commerce and alliance with France, where the people adulated him, but he and the other commissioners squabble constantly. While he was sole commissioner to France, he and John Jay and John Adams negotiated the treaty of Paris, which ended the war for', 'You might think that all fruit is mouth watering until you take a whiff of durian fruit.

The roasted seeds taste like almonds. Some say the fruit tastes like vanilla. Others', 'Intestines are organs, or body parts, that are shaped like long tubes. They help break down food so that the body can use it for energy. This is part of the process called digestion. The intestines also remove wastes from the body. Food enters the small intestine after it leaves the stomach. At this time the food is in the form of a thick liquid. Digestive juices from other organs, including the pancreas and the liver, enter the small intestine. They work with juices from the small intestine to break down the food into simple chemical substances. These substances then', "It is usually thought that the origin of board games goes back thousands of years to the time of primitive people, who invented such games to help them interpret the wishes of the gods. Primitive people also may have amused themselves by scratching a pattern into the sand, placing stones on it, and moving the stones around in a way that imitated the hunting and combat that were parts of their everyday lives. The board games played in today's world are games of skill and chance that are played by two or more people who move pieces around on a", "The features and tools vary from one site to the next, but you can usually find exactly what you need for free or for a very small fee.

Every year in July, local cowboys round up the wild ponies that live on the southern end of the island. At low tide, they lead the ponies across a narrow waterway called a channel to another island called Chincoteague. Thousands of people come to watch. The ponies swim across the channel in about five minutes with crowds cheering as the animals reach shore. Back on dry land, the ponies shake the water from their manes. Then they start to graze calmly. Some wander right up', 'But the new analysis shows that the giant squid from all of these regions are the same species, says a marine biologist and squid expert. A team of researchers looked at genes from 43 different giant squid. Taking such a close look at so many squid was no small feat: Most of what we know about these creatures comes from their carcasses that have washed ashore or have been found in the bellies of dead whales. The genetic study solved one mystery, the number of giant squid species, but turned up another. In general, only species with small populations are', "Many moving electrons are called an electric current. A city's power plant produces a powerful electric current and sends it through wires. The electricity used for lighting, heating, and running appliances is made by machines called generators. Generators cause a current to flow by moving a magnet past a coil of wire, which pushes electrons through the wires of the coil. Wires carrying the current travel to houses and other buildings. More wires connect to the power outlets in rooms. When a person plugs in an iron or another electric device, the current travels into the device. The current then", 'People see an object either because it gives off light or because the object reflects, or bounces back, light. For example, people see the Sun because it gives off its own light. But people see the moon only because it reflects light from the sun. When only the surface of an object can be seen, the object is said to be opaque. Opaque objects do not let light pass through them. Instead they reflect and absorb light. As a result, they are not see-through. For example, a mirror is an opaque object that reflects almost all of the light that', "Abs should be worked about two or three times per week. As with other groups, they should also rest at least a day or so in between workouts to allow the muscles to rebuild and add to the current muscle mass. Unfortunately, high volume training isn't going to yield any improvement in results.

The bears are very important to their culture. Native American tribes are challenging attempts by federal wildlife officials to end legal protections for the bears, which roam the wilderness in and around Yellowstone National Park. The tribes are concerned hunters will kill the bears, which they believe are sacred. The tribes opposition is the latest chapter in the history of these huge, ferocious animals. Grizzlies almost ceased to exist in the early nineteen hundreds because hunters had trapped and killed so many of them. The tribes' opposition adds something new to", 'Tiny water drops hovering in the air are called fog. Fog is like a cloud, but it is near the ground, not high in the sky. Thick fog makes it difficult to see the surrounding landscape. Fog forms from water vapor, which is water in the form of a gas. Water vapor in the air condenses, or turns back into liquid, when the air cools. Fog appears when this liquid gathers around bits of dust in the air. A gentle wind helps fog to form and to stay in the air.

They also learned that it was the oldest dome headed dinosaur specimen found in North America and possibly the world. The skull was also special because it belonged to a small dinosaur. It weighed around 40 kilograms and was about as tall as a large dog. Dr. Evans said paleontologists don't find many fossils from smaller dinosaurs. This may mean that there were fewer small dinosaurs than large ones. Or it may be because small dinosaur skeletons were destroyed by weather or", 'The sounds and syllables of language are combined by authors in distinctive, and often rhythmic, ways to form the literature called poetry. Language can be used in several ways to tell a story, marvel at the wonders of nature, explain the universe, give advice, or ponder the mysteries of life and death. Among these ways are the novel, short story, essay, and dramatic tragedy and comedy. All of these can be defined rather easily, and each has qualities that separate it from the rest. The purposes of poetry are highly diverse. Some poems are meant to entertain, others to inform.', "Millions of people on vacation visit the beaches of the Caribbean each year.

The traditional belief that the cerebellum is involved only in motor control comes from studies on monkeys. The studies indicate it is a separate structure at the base of the brain that is not connected to the rest of the brain. Recent studies in human brain structure, however, have shown something different. They indicate that over the course of human development the cerebellum established connections with many different brain regions. The findings may show that the different brain regions are interconnected. They', "Look closely at your nose in a mirror and you'll see what looks like tiny pits on the skin. These are pores.

As we move either up or down the earth, cutting the planet into two pieces produces one large piece and one small piece. As we approach the poles, the large piece gets very big, while the small piece becomes much smaller. Drawing these imaginary lines at different latitudes produces what we call parallels. Although technically it is possible to draw an infinite number of parallels', 'River water picks up and moves mud, pebbles, and larger rocks as it flows downstream. These particles rub against the riverbed and wear away more rock and soil. This kind of erosion helped to carve the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States. Over millions of years the swiftly moving waters of the Colorado River carried away bits of earth and rock from the land. Little by little the constant rush of water dug a canyon out of a flat stretch of ground. The pounding of ocean waves against land also causes erosion. The waves constantly move pebbles and sand', 'The lines running vertically around the earth are called longitude. These lines are called meridians, and measure how far east or west an object is. As with latitude, longitude is measured as an angular distance. With latitude, the angular distance is measured from the equator. This is a natural place to begin. However, with longitude there is no natural beginning point. One of these lines must be designated as a prime meridian, or as the 0 degree mark, but which one?

Some toys are made to teach children how to function in everyday life, such as toys with buttons, laces, velcro and snaps can teach them how to dress themselves as they learn to manipulate each closure. The amount of time your child will spend playing in his lifetime can be used to also help him learn more about himself and the world around him.', "Like all living things, rays are part of a food chain. They have to look for food and keep from becoming food. That's why rays have to look out for hungry predators, such as sharks. A ray's eyes are on top of its body. It scans the water above looking for carnivores diving down to eat it. Rays are carnivores, too. Their mouths are full of teeth the size of pinheads. Rows of these tiny teeth crush and grind prey. A ray uses several senses to find food. It uses its senses of touch and smell. It also uses a", 'Fermentation is a chemical change that happens in vegetable and animal substances. For thousands of years people have used fermentation to make bread, wine, beer, cheese, and other foods. Fermentation controls the growth of microorganisms. It kills some microorganisms and allows others that are not harmful to grow. The harmless yeast, bacteria, or mold that grows creates substances called enzymes. The enzymes break down food into chemicals. The result is a new food product that does not spoil as quickly. Cheese comes from milk or cream that has been fermented by bacteria. Soy sauce is made from fermented soybeans.', "There are plenty of fish in the sea. There are also plenty in the trash. Of all the food Americans waste, it is the seafood that never gets eaten that should trouble us most. After all, very few sources of nutrition are as healthy as fish. They are high in protein and low in fat. Eating fish is associated with all sorts of useful health outcomes. Yet few foods are discarded so frequently. In the last few years as much as half of all seafood was wasted. Families and food businesses buy fresh and frozen fish. Sometimes, they don't eat", "It may look like lightning strikes down from the cloud. In fact, the streak of lightning you see is the return stroke. It's going up to the cloud. You can't tell because it happens so fast. The most common type of lightning is called intracloud lightning. It blankets the sky with a brilliant flash of white. You can't see the lightning bolt. It is hidden. The lightning bolt arcs inside a cloud. From the ground, it looks like the cloud flickers. When lightning leaps across a gap of clear air between two different clouds, we call that intercloud lightning. Then", "Aromatherapy is an ancient practice of using certain aromatic fragrances to stimulate nerves within the nose. Those nerves reach the necessary part of the brain that controls certain functions. The science of aromatherapy is the use of scented oils that come from varying parts of flowers, plants, and in some cases bark. Different scents treat different types of conditions within our bodies. Medical conditions aren't immune from it. The aromatherapy isn't a replacement for medical treatments, but is used to enhance and to work alongside them to help treat your ailments.", 'With forex trading, the market is a liquid market. This means it has the potential to be easily changed. When it comes to trading in currency, that currency has a price tag attached. That price tag is known as the forex rate. A forex rate is referring to the measure in which a currency is priced. Whatever the currency is priced at is what the trader buys or then sells the currency for. When you think about how the forex runs and what forex rate is, just remember that to the trader, there are two rates you should know about.', "One condition that can be benefited from aromatherapy is certain types of allergies. The scent of choice for this condition is the blue tansy. It's thought to have a powerful effect on the nervous system, which aids in the bronchial dilation process. The blue tansy is also known to aid in pain management, because of the effect it has on the nervous system. Eucalyptus and pine scents are good for treating fatigue. They work by minimizing drowsiness and irritability, which can cause tiredness and lethargy. You'll be able to think clearly and stay alert throughout the day.", "It might be brought on by travel and you find that you're unable to fall asleep in a hotel room. With primary insomnia, there is no known cause, and this kind can be very frustrating to live with because there's nothing you can pinpoint as the reason that it began.

What you have to watch for is a pattern of sleeplessness and note when the", 'This will put an abundance of pressure on your lower back causing your body to compensate with poor posture. Your stride is created by your legs. The proper stride length for your body will differ from that of your running partner. Your feet should land directly underneath the body. Then as your foot strikes the ground your knee should be slightly flexible so that upon impact in can take the force and distribute it evenly throughout the body avoiding injury. Even your ankles and feet come into play when making sure you have the perfect running form. This is easy', 'Dung beetles are insects that eat animal dung, or manure. They are also known as tumblebugs. Scientists consider dung beetles to be beneficial insects because they convert manure into substances other organisms can use. There are thousands of species of dung beetles in the scarab beetle family. Some other species of beetle are also called dung beetles, but they do not form dung balls. Instead, they dig burrows underneath piles of manure. A dung beetle uses its head and antennae to roll dung into a ball. It then buries itself in the ball and feeds on the dung. Different species', 'Take great photos of your skating and then send them a video presentation. Ask other people on the boards to recommend you and to talk about the advice that you have given to them in relation to the company products. Attend all the events that they are sponsoring within your locality because you may get a chance to meet one of their executives.

It is from this background that you can send them a formal letter with a bio that is written specifically', 'In essence, you are going to have to recruit them, much like a college coach might recruit a person of superior talent. Consider this, in most scholarship situations, a person has to ask for one rather than them being solicited for a scholarship. In fact, the way scholarships are offered to potential students are less normal and less common than the traditional way of getting a scholarship, which is to request one. Another to remember is that you will have to be persistent as well. You will have to be aware that you might hear no a lot.', "It has been said that laughter is the best medicine. We have all at one time heard that famous line, but rarely if ever do we take it to heart. Laughter is one of the best and easiest releases for endorphins that your body has. Finding humor in situations that are extremely stressful can be hard to do in the moment. But finding the time to watch a romantic comedy, or a favorite comedian's stand up routine, and laughing the evening away will not only elevate your mood, but will also relieve stress. Finding time to enjoy the things you", "Many different kinds of grasses grow on the world's grasslands. Grasslands may have no trees or only a scattered few. Usually the land is flat. Sometimes it has rolling hills. Dust storms, tornadoes, and wildfires sometimes rage across grasslands. Grasslands are good for grazing livestock. Grasslands also have good soil for farming. Wheat, oats, corn, and other crops have replaced many wild grasses. The large animals that live in tropical grasslands include zebras, gazelles, lions, and kangaroos. Horses, antelope, hawks, and prairie dogs are a few of the animals that live in temperate grasslands. In the past wandering peoples lived", "Winter arrives in Antarctica in March. The continent is in the southern hemisphere and has seasons that are opposite those in the north. Nearly all creatures leave except for the Emperor penguin. They are the largest of the 17 species, and they spend their entire lives on Antarctic ice and in its waters. They survive by relying on a number of clever adaptations. Emperors clump together in huge, huddled masses. They take turns moving to the inside of the group, where they're protected from the icy cold temperatures and wind. These flightless birds breed in the winter. After a courtship", 'Can music tame the wild beast? Can it hush puppies and calm kitties? A veterinarian thinks so. The vet has put music in over one thousand animal shelters and says that it calms dogs and cats. And it even cuts down on barking. The vet started the nonprofit rescue animal project nearly four years ago. She asked artists around the world to donate dog and cat friendly music. The result was an MP3 player packed with thirty hours of classics. The classics include music by Beethoven, Mozart and Chopin. There were nursery rhymes like Three Blind Mice. And harps, pianos', "Conjuring, or magic, is a theatrical art in which a magician performs illusions that make the impossible seem possible. In this type of magic as entertainment, the spectators know that the magician is not actually using supernatural powers. Nevertheless, even though they may try to watch the magician's every move to discover how the magic is done, in a successful trick they are amazed, unable to discern the secret. While deceiving them, magicians challenge their abilities to perceive, imagine, and reason one of the aspects of magic that has long made it popular all over the world.", "The human body's largest organ, the skin, is active, living tissue. It serves as tough but flexible armor to keep harmful microbes, chemicals or strong rays of light away from more sensitive inner tissues. At the same time, nerves within the skin relay important information about the world around us by sensing pain, textures and temperatures. The skin you scrub every day in the bath or shower is only the outermost layer, called the epidermis. The epidermis is constantly shedding dead cells from its surface as new ones grow to take their places. Beneath that outer layer, the dermis contains", 'A whale that apparently took a wrong turn up an African river about seventeen million years ago may offer clues to the climate change forces that shaped human evolution. Lost for more than thirty years, the fossilized beak and jaw bone of the twenty two foot whale helps to determine that the East African plateau probably began rising no earlier than seventeen million years ago, according to a study. That geologic upheaval in an area known as the cradle of humankind is believed to be responsible for the gradual change of dense, humid forests into grasslands with fewer trees.

They weigh 20 to 45 pounds. Lynx have long legs and large, furry paws that help them move through snow. Their thick fur helps to keep them warm in cold weather. The fur is yellowish brown to gray, with darker brown and black patches. It is bushy on the neck. Lynx live alone or in small groups and hunt at night. Lynx eat birds and', 'Human beings experience brief subjective responses called emotions as feelings such as joy, sadness, fear, or anger. In addition to involving a feeling, emotions involve chemical changes in the brain, physical changes in the body, and emotional behaviors, such as facial expressions. In other words, they represent a synthesis of physical processes, feelings one experiences, and behaviors that express what one feels. Emotions are more fleeting than moods, and they result from more specific stimuli. Some animals other than humans also are thought to experience emotions.', "Some forms of yoga use chants in conjunction with meditation, and others employ the use of benches, blocks, chairs, and ropes. Most yoga participants also have a yoga mat they use during the poses, but it's not a necessity. While there are many yoga classes at your local health and fitness centers, you can also practice it at home using a DVD or web based tutorial.

Points can be considered an investment when it continuously yields a savings the longer you stay in the home. A chart can be prepared to show you the options and when the break even point occurs. Ask the lender to quote points in dollar amounts so you can easily see how much you're spending. It's thought the point system is used only in the United States. That's probably a plus for the creators of our financial system which enables more families to", 'Mesa Verde is best known for a large number of well preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in shallow caves and under rock overhangs along the canyon walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and plastered with adobe mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities, but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations', 'The basic stringed instruments of the modern symphony orchestra are in the lute family. This means that the strings are stretched over a long neck that extends from the body of the instrument. These instruments include the violin, viola, cello, and double bass. The strings are rubbed with a horsehair bow or plucked with the fingers. Unlike a harp, these instruments have only four or, rarely, five strings each. The sound is changed by using the fingers to press down on the strings at different points of the neck. This temporarily shortens the part of the string that makes the', "Fear of being fined or penalized is a form of extrinsic motivation. We're told to not smoke or we must wear seat belts and we obey these demands for fear of future health problems or receiving a fine. The reward comes for doing what we're told and not because they've instilled in us the desire to do these things because they're good for us. Extrinsic motivation is based on obligation of doing what we get paid for and not for the love of doing. But, regardless of its offensive qualities we must tolerate it everywhere, every day.", 'The olympic torch relay is an invention of the modern celebration of the games. Although torch relays took place in Athens, there were none at the ancient olympic games. Several months before the opening of the games, the olympic flame is kindled in Olympia, in Greece. The flame is then carried by the olympic torch in a relay to the city that is hosting the games. The torch may travel across oceans, mountains and deserts, as well as through cities and villages. The entry of the flame into the olympic stadium is one of the highlights of the opening ceremony,', 'Now, that top corner goal you scored on FIFA after that superb flowing move can be seen by millions. You may have achieved this sitting in a friends lounge, but this expression of skill can be viewed by almost anyone. It is a powerfully emotive feeling knowing that what you have just produced can bring joy to such a large number of people. The combination of almost limitless boundaries, the perfection of skills, and the ability to share this with all corners of this world, means that video games now offer the most incredible way in which to express yourself.', 'The change that a caterpillar undergoes to turn into a butterfly or a moth is called metamorphosis. Some caterpillars may take only a few days to make this change. Most, however, stay as caterpillars throughout the warm season. A small number may live as long as four years in the caterpillar form before they change. The first step for many caterpillars is to build a cocoon or shell. A caterpillar spins its cocoon with threads of sticky fluid that flow from an opening in the lower lip. The fluid hardens in the air to form the covering. Some caterpillars form', "New babies have little use for their own hands and mostly keep them loosely fisted. When babies start to keep their hands open during most of their waking hours, the hands are ready for use: ready to hold an offered rattle or to grip an adult's thumb. Around this time babies make the delightful discovery that one hand can hold, pull, and play with the other. Once babies have started fiddling with their own hands, they soon reach the important stage of finding those hands by eye as well as by touch. Having first noticed their own two hands playing", 'For a sound to be made and heard, three things need to happen. First, an object vibrates. A vibrating object makes tiny, very fast back and forth movements. For example, when a musician strums guitar strings, they vibrate. The vibration moves the surrounding air and produces waves of sound. Second, the sound waves pass into a medium. A medium is any substance through which the waves can travel. Sound waves may travel through many mediums. These include air, water, and solid objects. Sound waves pass through mediums in all directions. Third, some kind of receiver, such as the ear of', "Pluto is a weirder place than scientists had ever imagined. It has widely different landscapes, a family of wildly spinning moons and volcano like mountains that spew ice instead of rock. Those surprises are among the many that have been uncovered. The Pluto mission is offering scientists rich lessons. Even though Pluto is part of the solar system, it's so far away that scientists had known little about what it might be like. One surprising feature is a gigantic heart shaped basin that has begun charming observers on Earth. The basin is over five hundred miles wide and two miles", 'Scientists use an idea called wavelength to describe light waves. Like waves moving across a pool of water, light waves have peaks and valleys. The distance between two of these peaks is called a wavelength. Sunlight contains light waves with long, medium, and short wavelengths. The color of light depends on its wavelength. Red light has the longest wavelength. Violet light has the shortest wavelength. Orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo have wavelengths in between those of red and violet. When light waves of all the colors travel together, the light looks white.', 'Most objects have a balance of positive and negative charges, so they are considered neutral. This means that they do not push or pull on each other at all electrically. However, sometimes electrons can build up in an object. Two such objects can push or pull on each other because they are no longer neutral. This push or pull from extra electrons is called static electricity. Static electricity can cause interesting effects, like sparks or lightning bolts, when it is released. Sometimes the extra electrons build up by rubbing one object against another. For example, when one rubs a balloon', "When light from a distant source, such as the sun, strikes a collection of water drops such as rain, spray, or fog a rainbow may appear. It appears as a multicolored arc whose ends seem to touch the Earth. Rainbows are seen only when the observer is between the sun and the water drops, so rainbows appear in the part of the sky opposite the sun. The center of the rainbow's arc passes through the vertical plane defined by the light source and the observer's eye. Rainbows are most commonly seen when the sun's rays strike raindrops falling from distant", 'But the internet is rapidly smashing these traditional structures, and making the once all powerful middle man obsolete.

He peeked into their kitchen. He looked through their glass door. One evening the cub stood alone in the rain. It was looking for a way into the family's home. They live just across the mouth of the Columbia River from Astoria. The family fed the cub apple slices. The mother bear did not come back for two nights. So they called the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. A wildlife official got the cub into a bear trap. The official used apple slices to help catch the bear.", "People can pull out information stored in memory through either recall or recognition. Recall means that someone can remember something learned earlier. Recognition is the ability to identify something that has been seen or experienced before. Recognition is easier than recall. It may be easy to recognize a person's face, but it is more difficult to recall the person's name. Patterns are also easier to remember than random information. For example, it is easier to remember a poem that rhymes than one that does not.", "I have found that when you find the perfect composition, but the light is not quite right or something unwanted is in the frame, the tripod is indispensable. Color is what needs to stand out in your fall photos, so you should consider using the vibrant mode setting on your camera if it's available. If your camera is not equipped with this setting you can increase saturation to achieve the same effect. You can also tweak your photos after the fact with a photo editing program.

No two gamma ray burst light curves are identical, with large variation observed in almost every property: the duration of observable emission can vary from milliseconds to tens of minutes, there can be a single peak or several individual subpulses, and individual peaks can be symmetric or with fast brightening and very slow fading. Some bursts are preceded by a precursor event, a weak burst that is then followed, after seconds to minutes of no emission at', 'The Hubble Space Telescope is in orbit around Earth as a floating observatory. The Hubble magnifies and records images of distant space objects. It then sends the information to astronomers on Earth. Other manned and unmanned spacecraft also have gathered information about the sun, Moon, and planets. Astronomers also use cameras and other instruments to record information about distant objects. Photographs provide astronomers with a visual record of their observations. Other instruments can help reveal faint, hard to detect objects in outer space. These instruments measure the light and other radiation coming from the objects.', 'Choosing the right martial arts training for you can be extremely confusing and a little overwhelming given the huge number of options available. In simple terms, the vast majority of styles fall into one of three types. Namely, traditional styles such as Karate or Judo, combat sports styles like MMA or kickboxing or the self defense styles of Krav Maga or reality based self defense. Each has its pros and cons but there should be considerable overlap across these styles as there are a lot of common skills and after all the name martial arts does suggest some competency in', "The more uncomfortable you start to feel, the more stress starts to come on. Choose less salty snacks, like low salt pretzels or even a low salt version of your favorite potato chip. Junk food, in general, is considered stress inducing and poor in its nutritional components. When your body doesn't get enough of the necessary minerals and nutrients it needs, its chances of being able to handle stress are lowered. Eat yourself into a healthy state instead of toward a stressful one.

As that happens, the tree line that marks where forests stop and the treeless tundra starts has been shifting northward. Trees growing along the tree line must protect themselves from the cold wind. To do this, plants tend to grow horizontal limbs low to the ground. The energy it takes for trees to grow this way means they don't have enough leftover to make seeds. But as Earth's climate has been warming, trees no longer have to just grow horizontally. Many can instead grow up, toward the", 'Fiber optics is a way of sending information through thin fibers, or threads. The information may be sound, pictures, or computer codes. This information travels through the fibers in the form of light. The fibers, known as optical fibers, can be made of glass or plastic. They are about as big around as a human hair. Many fibers are bundled together to form a fiber-optic cable. Fiber optic cables link some telephones and computers. Doctors also use fiber optic instruments to see inside the human body. In a fiber optic system, a machine called a transmitter turns information into light.', 'The Industrial Revolution changed the world. The Revolution took place hundreds of years ago and was a time when many important technological advances were made. It made it easier for everyone to benefit from new inventions and ideas.

The Plantae kingdom is made up of all the plants that you see each day. Most plants are multicellular, meaning that they consist of many cells. Different types of plants include trees, grass, flowers, and some types of algae. Plants use the light from the sun to produce their own food. This allows them to grow almost anywhere, as long as there is enough water. Plants get their green color from the chlorophyll which is found inside of their cells. Plants use chlorophyll to collect energy from the light of the sun.', "Spiders feed mostly on insects. Some spiders are hunters that chase and overpower their prey. These spiders typically have a good sense of touch or sight. Other spiders instead weave silk webs to trap flying insects. Some spiders also use silk to wrap their prey, protect their eggs, or make nests. Spiders are the only animals that digest their food outside their bodies. After capturing its prey, a spider covers it with digestive juices. The juices break down the prey's body into a liquid form that the spider sucks up. Spiders repeat this process many times and eventually digest most", "It's a rare family that's not on a food budget. The family food shopper searches for any way possible to cut back on the amount of money spent on food. One of those is using coupons. Conservatively speaking, there are millions of coupons circulating every day that could cut your food budget by 30 to 50% even more if you're willing to turn couponing into a passion. Even the casual coupon clipper can become quite successful overnight and with more work and dedication become a super saver shopper. You have to be patient, flexible and perhaps give up your favorite", 'If you suffer from some pain in the joint areas, you can use Tai Chi to increase your range of motion within those joints, diminishing some of the pain. The muscles become more flexible and can endure more activity. If balance becomes a problem for you, use the Tai Chi exercises that are designed to train your body to work from its center to provide stability for your body at all times. It strengthens your core more each time you practice it. Balance within your mind can also be achieved through the use of Tai Chi. When you succumb to', "We become what we think. This quote has been proven over and over again. If we perceive something bad is going to happen to us, many times it does. On the contrary, if we believe something good is going to happen this often becomes true as well. Science has affirmed the link between positive affect and its impact on an individual's motivation and performance. If we expect the best or we expect the worst, we're usually not disappointed. Each time we perceive a positive thought it increases our own perceptions of positive expectancy. Positive thoughts enable you to achieve self", 'Rockets carry fuel that is burned inside a chamber. The fuel burns when it is mixed with oxygen gas and ignited, or set on fire. As the fuel burns, it gives off hot gas that shoots out from an opening at the back of the chamber. The force of the gas moving backward pushes the rocket forward. This action is called jet propulsion. The engines of a jet airplane also use jet propulsion. But unlike a jet engine, rockets carry their own oxygen supply. This makes rockets valuable in outer space, where there is no oxygen. Rocket fuel can be', "If you're still questioning whether or not what you are experiencing is viral or a result of an allergic reaction, consult your primary care doctor. Recognizing your allergy symptoms is a key element in keeping your health and body away from any potentially deadly risks. Allergy problems, sometimes called hay fever, affect millions of people all over the world. Keeping an eye out for the symptoms is easy because the eye is usually one of the first things affected. Most common symptoms are sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes caused by your body's attempt to ward off the harmful invasion", "Proper fit and design of a backpack is important to relieve pressure from the spine and shoulders. You want a backpack that's made for your size. Padded shoulder straps and a cushioned back will also prevent aches and pains. Small roller bags are an option, but some schools do not allow them because they pose tripping hazards, or may litter classroom aisles or hallways in the event of a fire. As a general rule, research shows the backpack should be no more than twenty percent of a child's body weight to avoid pain or potential injury. More recommend ten percent.", 'Sea serpents were supposed to be enormous snakes, or huge creatures that inhabited the deep sea. Sailors throughout the ancient world reported having seen such creatures. In Norwegian sea folklore, the kraken was an enormous creature, part octopus and part crab. Accounts of these fabled creatures might have been based on sightings of giant squid, which can reach a length of sixty feet. Mermaids were also mythical sea creatures. They were thought to have the head and upper body of a woman and the tail of a fish. Stories of mermaids may have come from people who saw water dwelling', "Cell division also occurs within certain plant tissues. These tissues help to carry water from the soil to the leaves. They also help to carry sugar from the leaves to the rest of the plant. New cells in these tissues cause the fibers that carry water and sugar throughout the plant to grow. The new cells also help a plant's thick outer covering to grow. After plant cells divide, the new cells increase in size when they take in and store water. The stored water causes pressure that pushes on the walls of the plant cells. This causes the cells", 'The microwave oven was invented by accident by a man who was orphaned and never finished grammar school. The man was Percy Spencer. Spencer left grammar school at the age of twelve and began working from sunup to sundown at a spool mill, which he continued to do until he was in his mid teens. At this time, he heard about a nearby paper mill that was electrifying, which intrigued him. Given that few in his town knew much of anything about electricity, he began learning what he could about it and managed to become one of three people who', 'There are two main herds of wild ponies on Assateague island. Each herd has 100 to 150 ponies and includes many pony bands. One herd lives on the Maryland side of the island. The other lives on the Virginia side. A fence at the state line keeps the herds apart. The ponies live together in small groups called bands. Some bands may have as few as two ponies. Others may have a dozen. In most bands there are usually several mares, or adult females, some foals, and one adult male pony. The adult male pony is called a stallion.

A natural diet consists of the common sense foods that we all know are good for us, such as fruit, vegetables, grains that are unrefined and', 'Very big volcanic eruptions can mess with life in several ways. First, they shoot clouds of ash high into the atmosphere. That can block out a lot of sunlight. The eruptions also may add heat to the oceans and atmosphere. This would warm surface temperatures across the globe, along the way altering weather patterns. Eruptions pump out gases, especially carbon dioxide. As a greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide keeps heat from escaping away into space. This too warms the climate. The oceans, too, will absorb plenty of carbon, leaving the water ever more acidic.', 'Obviously, for the novice surfer, dropping in on a wave at the very last second is not something we want to teach you. That is something that takes a lot of practice and skill. With all this in mind, we do not suggest learning on a short board. Longboards are primarily single finned surfboards with large rounded noses and can range in length anywhere from 9 to 15 feet in length. These characteristics make for great surfing in a variety of conditions. Long boards are also a lot thicker and wider than a short board. As a beginner, this is', 'Toucans are mainly fruit eaters, but they will also eat large insects, snakes, frogs, and lizards. Sometimes they invade the nests of songbirds and eat eggs or even young birds. A toucan grabs food with the tip of its bill and throws its head back to move the food toward the throat. The sawlike edge of the bill helps the bird tear apart large fruit. Toucans are among the noisiest birds in the forest. They make loud barks, bugling calls, and harsh croaks. Larger toucans sometimes raise a commotion that attracts other toucans to trees with good fruit. Apart from', "Let's start at the top of your body and work down, your head. The way you hold your head is very important to how the rest of your body then aligns. This also effects how efficiently your overall run is. Remember to look out in front of you instead of looking down at your feet. Watching where you are going is going to help your posture far more than if you are looking at where you are and have been.

Many families spend time together, and kids are able to catch up with their friends and participate in activities they may not have time for when school is in session. School vacations are also a time when some students get a break from homework. Many school districts and teachers don't give homework over breaks. One school board recently passed a resolution that bans homework during the winter and spring vacation periods. When homework or projects are designed and deadlines are assigned in a way that requires students to", 'Humans are advanced creatures, but we are not so good at measuring time. Our sense of how much time is passing often depends on what is going on in our lives, what we are doing at a certain moment, or even on our mood. This causes a lot of unusual things to happen, like the return trip effect, which often happens when we go somewhere for the first time. When we go somewhere new it often seems that the trip back took less time than the trip to get there. This is especially strange considering both trips are exactly the', 'Adobe is a type of clay that is used to make bricks. People in many dry parts of the world use adobe bricks to build buildings. This is partly because there are few trees in these regions to supply wood for building. People make adobe bricks by wetting clay and then adding straw or another type of fiber. They mix the material and pour it into molds. The molds have four sides and are open at the top. People then lay the bricks out in the sun to dry, which can take several weeks. When they are dry, the adobe', 'Congress appropriated money to complete three new frigates and to build additional ships, and authorized the raising of a provisional army. It also passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, intended to frighten foreign agents out of the country and to stifle the attacks of Republican editors. President Adams did not call for a declaration of war, but hostilities began at sea. At first, American shipping was almost defenseless against French privateers, but by 1800 armed merchantmen and US warships were clearing the sea lanes. Despite several brilliant naval victories, war fever subsided.', "Like its relatives the crabs and the shrimps, a lobster has five pairs of legs. On many lobsters the first pair has large claws. One of the claws grows larger than the other. It is used for crushing food. The smaller claw is sharp and can grab and tear prey. A lobster can grow a new leg or claw if it loses one. In addition to the ten legs, a lobster has several structures on the underside of the body that help it to move. These swimming legs are called swimmerets.

Toys, books, musical recordings, games, and other objects for play should show respect for the child's world. A good plaything stimulates children to do things for themselves. They soon become bored with a toy that can do only one thing. Play equipment should encourage children to explore and to create, or it should offer them opportunities for dramatic play. Fairly large toys are important for young children because their muscle coordination has not developed well enough for them to handle small", 'Every summer Florida residents battle swarms of mosquitoes. They do this by spraying pesticides. However, new research has found that routine spraying is causing much greater harm to innocent bystanders, butterflies. A study was done to address the growing number of butterflies going extinct. Researchers found two common chemicals used in spraying, at amounts typically used to control mosquitoes, were toxic to butterflies. While researchers have long suspected that pesticides killed butterflies, the research confirmed this and documented the deadly amounts. They also found that spraying may have lasting effects.', 'Many women use cosmetics for the face. Makeup, or foundation, gives the face color and highlights the features.

But the balloonist can change altitude by throwing ballast overboard or by releasing gas. So fine is the balance between gas and weight that a second's escape of gas or a pound of sand thrown overboard can cause a sharp change in altitude. As the balloon rises, the lesser pressure of the upper air permits the gas to expand. The balloon tends to go higher and higher. If the expanding bag threatens to burst,", "Dieters can also benefit from this flavorful tea. Green tea is known for its ability to help your body burn off some of the daily calories you take in.

Finally, be sure the hot rocks to be buried are covered with four to six inches of dirt to prevent burns, and allow enough time for the moisture to be baked from the ground before bedding', "A Japanese rock garden, sometimes misnamed Zen garden, is a sand box with sand, rocks, and very occasionally grass. The sand in these gardens tends to represent water, with the ridging caused by rakes to symbolize the ripples. The rocks would then be islands. Some people believed these gardens were supposed to soothe the mind, but this was not the original intention. Understanding how to put together an effective garden for your terrain type would enhance your landscape. Just because you don't have fertile soil or lots of space without rocks, it doesn't mean you can add to your landscape", 'Shoppers flocked to the air conditioned store. The boom in human cooling spread from the department stores to the movie theaters, most notably the Rivoli theater in New York, whose summer film business skyrocketed when it heavily advertised the cool comfort. Demand increased for smaller units and the Carrier Company obliged. In 1928, Carrier developed the first residential Weathermaker, an air conditioner for private home use. The Great Depression and then WW2 slowed the non industrial use of air conditioning. After the war, consumer sales started to grow again. The rest is history, cool and comfortable history.', "Lightning is often followed by thunder. A lightning bolt instantly heats the nearby air to temperatures hotter than the surface of the sun. The sizzling hot air usually has no time to expand when the lightning strikes. So it just explodes outward with a loud boom. We call that sound thunder. Lightning and thunder happen at just about the same time. However, light travels a lot faster than sound. That's why we see lightning before we hear the thunder. We don't always hear thunder when we see lightning. Sometimes the thunder is too far away.

One of the best early reading strategies you can practice with your child is to read with them and as you repeat the words, follow along with your finger. When children first begin taking an interest in reading, they have little idea that those funny looking squiggles on the page actually mean something. By following along as you read, perhaps even pausing to sound out a word or two on the way, you'll help your child to better grasp the concept of the fact that those marks on the page", "If you have ever cashed in a piggy bank full of hard earned money, you know how tough it can be to save for the future. But when the reward is big enough a new smartphone perhaps it's easier to wait. There's a trade off between the size of the reward and the amount of time we are willing to wait for it.

Sauropods were plant eaters that walked on four legs. Sauropods had a very small head and brain when compared to their huge body. But they had a long neck, which let them reach leaves on even the tallest trees. They had thick, strong legs, like those of an elephant. Many sauropods probably could stand up on their back legs to reach even higher into the trees. They used their long, muscular tail to balance themselves when standing. Some sauropods also might', "Cooling or freezing food slows the growth of the microorganisms within it. Long before refrigerators were invented, people would freeze food in snow and ice or cool food in streams and caves. Underground cellars beneath houses were cool, dry places where people stored food. Ice houses were insulated buildings containing ice. They were built outside of people's homes to store food. People's kitchens also had ice boxes, which were insulated boxes filled with ice for storing food. Ice was delivered to homes to fill the ice houses or iceboxes. Mechanical refrigeration and freezing developed in the eighteen hundreds. This allowed", "When buildings collapse in future disasters, a robotic cockroach may be the new hero helping rescue people. Disgusting as they may be, roaches have the remarkable ability to squish their bodies down to one quarter their normal size, yet still scamper at lightning speed. Also, they can withstand nine hundred times their body weight without being hurt. That's similar to a two hundred pound man who wouldn't be crushed by ninety tons on his head. The amazing cockroach inspired scientists to create a mini robot that can mimic those feats of strength and agility.

Wind forms sand dunes and changes their shape. It also blows soil off dry farmland. As wind throws sand and soil at rock, the shape of the rock slowly changes. The huge masses of ice called glaciers also cause erosion. Glaciers scrape away parts of the rocks and the earth below as they creep down mountain valleys. They carry this material along with them. Glaciers can even move boulders as big as houses. When the glaciers melt, the moved rocks and earth stay', 'Resembling huge, squishy darts with tentacles, giant squid live in the darkest depths of the ocean. People seldom see these mysterious creatures. But scientists just got to know the animals much better. In a study published in March, researchers clear up a long-standing mystery about how closely these animals are related. They find the colossal creatures belong to a single global species. A species is a group of organisms that are similar enough to breed with each other. Until now, scientists had thought that giant squid belonged to three different species. One species lived in the North Atlantic ocean, another', 'There have been many advancements in the tools farmers use and in the way farmers grow crops. Farmers use tractors and other machinery to make planting and harvesting easier and faster. Farmers who live in dry areas also use irrigation, or artificial watering. Farmers can also use chemicals to help keep their crops free of pests. These chemicals, or pesticides, create a larger yield for the farmer who uses them. However, the use of these chemicals can harm people and the environment. As a result, some farmers choose to not use pesticides.

Earth passes through the orbit of some comets. Bits of dust left behind by the comets crash into the gases surrounding Earth. They burn up in the sky in what is called a meteor shower. The main part of a comet is called", "You've probably been driving for many years and when you learned how to drive the price of gas was no doubt considerably cheaper than it is now. You might remember as a teen driver, it was cool to drive fast, peel out, stop suddenly and just drive for entertainment. Those habits were excused because you were young and the cost of gas was nothing compared to costs today. Almost everyone drove impatiently and in a hurry to get wherever it was they were going if they were going anywhere at all.

A newborn baby has around 350 bones in their body. As they grow older, many of these bones fuse together. When two bones fuse together, they grow together, becoming one larger bone. An adult has approximately 206 bones. Nearly half of the bones in your body are', 'Assateague is a long, narrow island. It stretches between southern Maryland and northern Virginia. On one side is the atlantic ocean. On the other side is a quiet bay. The ponies have been roaming free on the island for hundreds of years. They are feral animals. This means that their ancestors once were tame. No one knows exactly how the ponies got to the island. Some people believe that long ago the first ponies were being transported by ship from Spain. They think the ship wrecked near the island in a storm, and the ponies swam ashore. Most experts, though,', 'Getting sponsorship from a major company is akin to landing a record contract for a pop singer. It means that you can rest easy knowing that many of the expenses will be paid in due course. There are ways in which you can make contact and they will take you seriously. Of course you have to have the skills. They are not going to ignore your failures just because you have written them a nice letter. It is important that you behave professionally or else it will be very difficult to help you.

These actions are believed to either correct the flow of qi or to reinforce it. Even though it cannot be proven that this works as a type of pain relief, it is thought that as a result the central nervous system is stimulated. Most patients say that they get a pins and needles sensation on the insertion of the needles and into the duration of the treatment, which usually lasts about 30 minutes. The', 'The favored theory for the origin of most short gamma ray bursts is the merger of a binary system consisting of two neutron stars. According to this model, the two stars in a binary slowly spiral towards each other due to the release of energy via gravitational radiation until the neutron stars suddenly rip each other apart due to tidal forces and collapse into a single black hole. The infall of matter into the new black hole produces an accretion disk and releases a burst of energy, analogous to the collapsar model. Numerous other models have also been proposed to', "Ivory has been making their floating soap for well over a century now and in that time they've become one of the most popular soap brands in the world. For many years, the company has maintained that the discovery of its trademark floating soap was a complete accident, but exactly how true is this? For those of you who aren't familiar with Ivory brand soap, in a nutshell its two key selling points are that it is incredibly pure and that it floats, making it superior to all other kinds of soap because you don't need to grope around on", "There are many causes for sleep apnea, including obesity and obstructed air passages. Its symptoms are loud snoring sounds that are sometimes interrupted by a few seconds, or minutes, of lapses in breathing. The silence is often followed by loud gasps for air until regular breathing resumes. Sufferers of sleep apnea often have trouble functioning during the day and may fall asleep at their desks or even while driving a car. This extreme tiredness often leads to depression, high blood pressure, and loss of memory. That's why a swift diagnosis is so important and why those who suffer from sleep", "For a small fee, players are allowed to play in an upbeat environment.

To produce brown rice, only the first layer is removed. More layers are removed to create white rice. Brown rice is much higher in nutrients than white rice. Rice is eaten alone and in a great variety of soups, side dishes, and main dishes. In eastern Asia people grind rice into flour to make rice cakes and pastry. The people of Japan, China, and India use rice to make liquor. The parts of the plant that are not eaten can be used to make', 'In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century. While much of the construction in these sites conforms to common Pueblo architectural forms, including kivas, towers, and pit houses, the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what seems to have been a far denser concentration of their populations. Mug house, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and', "An ore is a natural combination of minerals from which metals can be extracted at a profit. Originally the term ore was applied only to metallic minerals, but the term now includes non metallic substances that have been deposited in rock after its formation. All metals come from ore deposits found in the Earth's crust. Raw ores bear little resemblance to familiar metals such as chromium or nickel. In most cases, the metals in the ores are not in the free, or pure, state. They are in chemical combination with other elements. They are combined with oxygen as oxides, with", 'They then diverted to Elephant and Castle in order to return through the subway to Angel. The Kennington service was not commercially viable and services were diverted to operate to Queens Road in Battersea. Due to a low bridge this service could only be operated with single deck vehicles.

It makes the cocoon with silk that comes out of a tube in its head. The silkworm wraps a single long strand of silk around itself over and over again. Some spiders also make silk. They weave silk webs to catch insects to eat. However, the silk made by spiders is too thin for making cloth. In the silk industry, silkworms are raised from the time they are eggs until they have made a cocoon.

The skateboarder stays balanced on the board by shifting the feet and body. The best skateboarders can invent and perform difficult tricks. The two main styles of sport skateboarding are vertical and street style. Vertical skating features aerial acrobatics performed in half pipes. Street style skating features tricks performed in a real or simulated urban environment with stairs, rails, ledges, and other obstacles. These styles of skateboarding have been organized into competitions.', "In 1912, Titanic is the largest man made moving object in the world.

They moved their villages close to the springs. They learned to survive on what they could find in the desert. Jack rabbits, quail, and bighorn sheep provided meat. People learned to grind up pods from mesquite trees and make small cakes to eat. Branches and twigs became the walls and roofs of open, airy homes. During the hottest season, the Timbisha moved into the mountains. There, the climate was cooler. The rest of the year, though, they lived in the valley. The Timbisha lived this unchanging life for centuries. They', 'Motorcycles are designed for different purposes. Street bikes, touring bikes, and small mopeds and scooters are built mainly for riding on paved roadways. Touring bikes are specially equipped for long distance highway travel. Lightweight dirt bikes, racing bikes, trail bikes, and minibikes are meant for off road biking. Motorcycle riders need their hands and their feet to drive their vehicles. The driver turns on the engine using a key. Once the engine is on, the driver uses controls on the handlebars and foot pedals to drive. Gears on the handlebars control the speed of the vehicle. The handlebars also have', 'There are many books and online help that teach how to perform reflexology, but even a simple massage of the feet can increase circulation. Increasing circulation in the feet helps other parts of the body receive more oxygen and also helps to eliminate metabolic waste products that may inhibit sleep patterns. Another important part of reflexology treatments that helps to treat insomnia is that they relieve tension and stress by total relaxation of the body. As the reflexologist works on the feet, the patient can begin to relax immediately and feel a sense of well being and energy surging through', "While this is an acceptable and reasonable practice, it may not be the best process for you in the long run.

It is the capital of the Veneto region. The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC. The city stretches across 117 small islands in the marshy Venetian lagoon along the adriatic sea. The situation of the city on islands has limited modern suburban spread beyond the historic center. Its framework of canals and narrow streets has prevented the intrusion of automobiles. Other than at the great parking lots at', 'There are many good reasons to raise your child bilingually. Maybe you live in a multilingual community, or would like to enhance the future job prospects of your children, or you and your partner come from different countries and want your child exposed to both cultures. Apart from cultural enrichment, there are also cognitive advantages to learning more than one language. Bilinguals perform better at tasks that call for selective attention such as focusing, inhibiting, and switching attention during problem solving. The current theory is that speaking two languages calls for selective attention to minimize interference between languages and ensure', "If you have a small yard, you should probably stick with a smaller pond. Larger yards can comfortably house larger ponds. If you have very little space, you could use a container for your water garden. You don't need a lot of fancy features in your water garden.

But eventually, you may want to enter the world of master tournaments, such as the United States dog agility association. When it comes to scoring a professional trial for a dog agility competition, there are three basic ways the performance can be scored: standard scoring, time plus faults scoring, and points based scoring. With standard scoring, the dog and handler are judged against the STC, or standard course time that is predetermined by a", 'Cardiac muscle is located in the heart. The fibers of this muscle form a structure like a net. The fibers form the chambers, or hollow areas, of the heart. As the cardiac muscle contracts and relaxes, blood moves in and out of the chambers. Cardiac muscle is involuntary muscle, which means that it moves automatically. A person does not have to think about telling the heart to beat. The cardiac muscle does not have nerves to tell it to move, either. A special strip of cardiac muscle releases bursts of electricity that help the heart to beat in a regular', 'Over time, the oyster will apply several layers of nacre to the foreign body, effectively walling it off from the oyster itself and forming a pearl of some shape, with the shape of the invading body being one potential contributing factor to the ultimate shape of the pearl. The internal process of pearl creation is mostly the same whether the pearl was created naturally or cultivated. However, despite generally needing to do an X-ray test to determine whether a given pearl was cultivated or grown naturally, natural pearls tend to have microscopic cores so only show concentric growth rings at', 'They found no difference between men and women in ordinary yawning. However, women did catch yawns much more often than men did. Scientists also found that both men and women yawned when friends and family yawned. Neither one yawned very often when people that they did not know well yawned. Scientists say the fact that women have more empathy could affect more than just social yawning. It could make them better parents, better at communicating, and better at living in groups. Greater empathy may also allow women to have relationships that last longer.', "A crossbow is an incredibly old firearm, which is more compact and accessible than the stand up bow and arrow. They are small, light and compact. All crossbows are similar in construction as they provide the same function, to shoot an arrow through the air. Crossbows vary in material from wood, to plastics, alloys and aluminum, to the new high end carbon materials. The material used will depend on the owner's price point and request. Wood will be strong and durable and heavy and cumbersome. Plastics will be light, but not as durable and strong. Alloys and aluminum will be", 'Here are two simple ways to heat a shelter that cannot use an internal fire. Using these methods there will be no need to spend another cold night again. The first method is to place several football sized rocks in the fire and cook them for an hour or two. Dig a hole in the work area of the shelter about one foot by one foot and six inches deep. After the rocks are hot, remove them with forked sticks and place in the hole. They will keep you warm all night. Be sure to keep all flammable materials from', 'In the United States, you can find organizations that conduct trials through local dog training clubs. These groups adhere to the rigid international rules for agility performance. During a dog agility competition, the participants are judged, not only on speed, but also on physical performance within the obstacle course. Each country also has its own set of domestic rules they sometimes go by, such as scoring that is handler based rather than performance based. Ideally, the organization handling the trial will ensure that the agility obstacle course is designed with the safety of the dog in mind.', 'A colored object reflects only certain wavelengths of light. The reflected light is the color the object appears to be. For example, a red apple absorbs all the colors of light that hit it except for red light, which the apple reflects. The red apple is opaque because it does not let light pass through it. If an object does not reflect or absorb much light, the light passes through it. This type of object is called transparent, or see through. Clear glass and clean water are transparent. Objects that allow some light to pass through them but that are', 'Humans have two eyes. Each eyeball sits in a socket, or opening, in the skull. The skull bone protects the eye on the sides and back. The eyelid protects the front of the eye. By blinking, eyelids also move tears across the eye. Tears keep eyes moist. Eyelashes catch dust and other particles that could enter the eye. Six muscles hold the eyeball in place and move it up, down, and sideways. The eyeball is filled with a clear jelly. Three coats, or layers, surround this jelly. The outer coat consists of the sclera, or white part of the eye,', 'A black hole is an area in space with an incredibly strong force called gravity. This gravity pulls in everything that gets close. Nothing, not even light, can escape from a black hole once it has been pulled in. Black holes are not actually holes. They have great amounts of material packed in very tightly. They are remarkably heavy for their size. This gives black holes their strong inward pull. They are called black because they are invisible. That is because no light can bounce off a black hole. All the light that gets near one is trapped inside. Because', 'A bicycle is an example of a compound machine that uses a chain to transfer force. The chain runs around two separate toothed wheels, which act as pulleys. One is attached to the axle of the rear wheel. The other is attached to the pedals through an axle. The pedals work like the crank of a wheel and axle machine. The force used to turn the pedals becomes a stronger turning force on the axle and its toothed wheel. The chain transfers the force to the rear wheel and makes it turn. In some bicycles the chain can be shifted', "With so many demands on our fresh water supply, do we have enough? Although earth is not running out of fresh water, it is not always there for people when and where it's needed. Some places have too much water. Other places don't have enough. Just six countries have half of the world's supply of fresh water. The people of Greenland have more than enough water. Only 60,000 people live there. Each one has access to millions of liters of water each day. Yet people in places like the Marsabit village struggle to get the water they need. In some", 'Many high school students want to get into a top college. To do this, they must have good grades and high test scores. All this can be very stressful. There is a new report from Harvard, one of the top schools in the world. The report says the university is concerned that the younger generation may be too worried about getting good grades. Students have mixed feelings about the report. Some praise universities who say they want to ease pressure on young people. Others wonder how the schools can measure the qualities that schools say they are looking for. One', 'There are three bones in the arm. The upper bone of the arm is called the humerus. The top of the humerus fits into a cup like socket in the shoulder. The bone and the socket make a joint that is held together by tough strands called ligaments. This joint allows the upper arm to swing and rotate. A pair of muscles is attached to the humerus. One muscle bends the arm. The other muscle straightens it. The lower end of the humerus connects to a bone called the ulna at a joint in the elbow. The ulna and another', 'Aromatherapy has long been touted as a beneficial therapy for physical conditions. But it can also be good for your mental health as well. Extracting the scented oils from various plants, aromatherapy products permeate your body and mind to offer relaxing, healthful benefits that last.

You might notice whenever you chew a piece of cinnamon gum or eat something citrus based that it perks you up a', 'Cheetahs live alone or in small groups. They hunt small animals, mainly during the day. After creeping up on an animal, a cheetah sprints at it from a few hundred feet away. The cheetah can keep up the chase for only a short time before tiring. When the cheetah does catch its prey, it trips the animal and bites into it. About three months after mating, a female cheetah gives birth to two to eight cubs. Cheetah cubs stay with their mother for more than a year while they learn to hunt. Some cheetahs in zoos have reached the age', "Oil and water don't mix. You have probably heard this old saying. It isn't just folk wisdom, however. It's chemistry. Another common expression like water off of a duck's back illustrates the same basic principle. The oil on a duck's feathers repels water and prevents the bird from getting soaked in the rain. Naturally oily feathers also help keep a bird dry as it swims. Chemistry is just one way to repel water in nature. Structure, or the shape of things, is another. To excel at water repellency, the lotus leaf relies on both. Unlike water lilies, the lotus holds", "Blogging has been around for a long time on the internet. It started out as a creative outlet for people to take their personal journals online to share with family and friends. It branched out into outlets of information to be shared by experts and now people use them for a money making opportunity. Blogs are excellent tools to earn some extra money without having to invest start up cash. They're loved by the search engines because blogs are usually updated frequently, unlike websites that are updated less often.

As they fall they can clump together with other ice crystals to form snowflakes. One snowflake can contain as many as one hundred ice crystals. But some single ice crystals fall as snow, too. The way that ice crystals join together gives every snowflake a unique design. Even so, most snowflakes have six points or six sides. They form seven basic shapes stars, needles, dendrites, plates, columns, columns capped with plates, and irregular. What shape a snowflake takes depends', 'Wylee the border collie can search an avalanche the size of a football field. It takes him five or ten minutes. It would take a probe line of fifty people using poles a couple hours to cover the same ground. When thirty minutes can mean the difference between life and death for a skier lost on a snowy mountain, most people would bank on the dog. The fastest thing is a dog. Faster than a beacon or echo. Speed is crucial in avalanche rescues. Chances of survival are minimal if victims are buried for thirty minutes or more. Wylee is', "When you suffer from sleep apnea it is important to practice good sleeping habits. Don't sleep on your back. Use pillows to elevate your head and shoulders. Sleeping on your back can sometimes cause your tongue to block an air passage. Some people have found that aromatic oils from plants and herbs such as nutmeg, lavender and orange can reduce the more severe effects of sleep apnea. Try placing aromatherapy oils on the nightstand next to your bed. Apnea is the Greek word for without breath. When you succeed in regulating how you breathe when sleeping, sleep apnea will be", "Humans need water, too. We use it to drink, bathe, flush, wash, and garden. At home, every American uses about 100 gallons of fresh water on average every day. Europeans use about half of that. In the Marsabit village in Kenya where people rely on wells and do not have indoor plumbing, each person must get by on as little as 5 gallons each day. Growing food uses the most water of all. It takes 31 gallons to grow one pound of potatoes. Livestock like cows need even more water. It takes 630 gallons to grow one hamburger. That's not", 'Scientists also think that there are different types of memory. These include motor skill, factual, and emotional memory. Motor skill memory tells people how to do physical things that they have done before. It can be short term or long term. People use motor skill memory to copy a dance step and to ride a bicycle. Factual memory is the storage of facts. It can be short term or long term. Factual memory lets people remember faces, numbers, and the experiences that happen to them. Emotional memory is the memory of emotions. It is long term. For example, people tend', 'Hubble pictures have helped scientists guess the age and size of the universe. Scientists think the universe is about 13 or 14 billion years old. Hubble has also helped scientists understand how planets and galaxies form. A picture called hubble ultra deep field shows the farthest galaxies ever seen. Hubble pictures start out as shades of black and white. Colors are then added to the pictures to help show how an object might look to the human eye. Hubble has spotted black holes. Black holes suck in everything around them, including light. Hubble has also helped to discover dark energy.', 'Smooth muscle cells are connected directly to one another, allowing electrical pulses to pass through them. Cardiac muscle is a special type of tissue that is only found within your heart. Did you know your heart is actually a very strong muscle? Like skeletal muscle cells, cardiac muscles cells are striated, or striped. Like smooth muscle cells, cardiac muscle cells are not under the control of your brain, but instead operate independently. Also like smooth muscle cells, the cells of your heart are connected directly to one another, allowing electrical pulses to flow through them.', 'One of the major benefits of riding a mountain bike on a regular basis is that in order to ride your bike you use some of largest muscles in the body which in turn will burn off fat quickly. This will of course help you to lose weight and the more you ride your bike the more weight you will lose. When you ride your bike on flat ground at a slower speed you are still burning a great amount of calories due to the fact that you will be able to continue that pedaling motion for a longer period', 'Acid rain is rain that has been made acidic by certain pollutants in the air. Acid rain is a type of acid deposition, which can appear in many forms. Wet deposition is rain that has become more acidic than normal. Dry deposition is another form of acid deposition, and this is when gases and dust particles become acidic. Both wet and dry deposition can be carried by the wind, sometimes for very long distances. Acid deposition in wet and dry forms falls on buildings, cars and trees and can make lakes acidic. Acid deposition in dry form can be inhaled', 'Light exists in two very different forms at the same time. One form is tiny particles called photons. The other form is waves. The easiest way to think about light is as waves. Light waves travel through space at extremely high rates of speed. Scientists use an idea called wavelength to describe light waves. Like waves moving across a pool of water, light waves have peaks and valleys. The distance between two of these peaks is called a wavelength. Sunlight contains light waves with long, medium, and short wavelengths. The color of light depends on its wavelength. Red light has', "Benjamin Franklin incorporated several ideas into a better glass instrument for players. First, he envisioned bowls that were already perfectly tuned. That way, one would not need to mess with having just the right amount of liquid inside to correct intonation problems. Actually making bowls that were tuned to specific tones turned out to be quite difficult; for every 100 bowls made, only one would be suitable for Franklin's instrument. Second, his bowls would be lined up in close sequence on a spindle that would rotate via a foot pedal; this removed the need to rotate one's own hands, as", 'Weathering is a natural process that slowly breaks apart or changes rock. Heat, water, wind, living things, and other natural forces cause weathering. Over many years, weathering can shape rock into unusual formations. Weathering is responsible for many rock arches and hoodoos also called lumpy columns. Weathering also has shaped the slabs of limestone. Weathering is related to erosion, which is the wearing away of rock and earth by natural forces. However, erosion generally means that bits of rock and earth are carried away from their original location. By contrast, weathering leaves the main area of rock in place.', "Researchers at the University of Toronto studied three groups of people: 20 people who played a shooting game called Medal of Honor, 20 people who played the driving game Need for Speed, and 20 people who played a puzzle game called Ballance. The people who played the shooting and driving games became faster and more accurate at searching for things, says the lead author of the study. The people who played the puzzle game did not improve their ability to find things faster. Researchers also compared video game players against people who didn't play video games. They found that the", 'The Prime Meridian is the meridian of longitude that passes through Greenwich, England. On the opposite side of the earth at 180 degrees longitude lies an imaginary line called the International Dateline. If you took a cruise on a ship circumventing, or traveling around the entire planet, you would experience firsthand a phenomena that would help you understand the importance of an international Dateline. An explorer by the name of Ferdinand Magellan did just that in the year 1519. Magellan, along with 241 men, set out to travel around the entire earth. These men kept very careful records as they', 'Gamma ray bursts are flashes of gamma rays associated with extremely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant galaxies. They are the most luminous electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe. Bursts can last from ten milliseconds to several minutes, although a typical burst lasts 20 to 40 seconds. The initial burst is usually followed by a longer lived afterglow emitted at longer wavelengths. Most observed GRBs are believed to consist of a narrow beam of intense radiation released during a supernova event, as a rapidly rotating, high mass star collapses to form a neutron star, quark star,', 'Rewards are not always great. It can be as minor as a gold star or your name on the honor roll. Students who are extrinsically motivated might work tirelessly on an assignment in exchange for a good grade. But doing the work just for the sheer pleasure is not acceptable to that person. The student may find the assignment extremely boring but the anticipation of receiving an exemplary grade is enough to keep the student motivated until the task is complete. Punishments and rewards are used to control the motivation of students with the teachers clearly in control.', "The ancient Egyptian Queen Nefertiti has long been at the center of a mystery. For years archaeologists have wondered where her tomb might be hidden. Nefertiti belonged to the family line of the famous King Tutankhamun, better known as King Tut. Indeed, some believe she was Tut's mother. While the other royals in her line are all accounted for, Nefertiti is still missing. Now an archaeologist claims to have found her secret tomb. He says it is in the Valley of the Kings, hidden just beyond a wall near the resting place of Tut.

Seen from here, the sun appears three times larger in the sky than it does", "Extrinsic motivation is one of the oldest and most common forms of motivation in the world. Simply stated, when we experience extrinsic motivation we expect to be rewarded. A more formal definition refers to motivation that's derived from outside a person. The motivating factors come externally in the form of rewards such as money or, in the case of a student, rewards come in the form of grades. It's the reward that provides satisfaction from completing the task and not the pleasure of doing it.

These airports are usually much closer to a city than their bigger international and domestic counterparts. Chartered planes also fly to and out of major airports, albeit at a different terminal from major airlines. Imagine all the things that make air travel a hassle; a separate terminal from the hordes of travelers provides a solution for every one of those problems. Passengers can breeze through the security screening and avoid getting stuck behind a line of people. There is no need to sit around at the boarding gate or shell out', 'The Royal gorge rafting adventure is one of a kind, and provides an adrenaline thrilled ride for the person looking for excitement.

In the summer they face hot weather and biting insects. In the winter they must grow thick coats to protect themselves from bitter winds. Spring and fall are the best seasons. The weather on the island is mild, and there is plenty of grass for the ponies to eat. The ponies also eat leaves and twigs. They even munch on poison ivy, which doesn't seem to bother them. These island grazers may be the size of ponies, less than 58 inches tall, but they are actually horses. Experts think that the", "Spinosaurus was not the heaviest of meat eaters, but some scientists think it may have been one of the longest at up to fifty feet long. Spinosaurus is best known for its tall, thin back spines. These spikes reached up to seven feet high. Perhaps they were connected with skin in the shape of a sail. Why? That's also a mystery. But maybe the sail helped it cool off in the hot sun near the Equator. Or it may have helped to impress their mates. This was not the only dinosaur with a sail roaming at that time. Ouranosaurus, a", 'There would be four grooves, on the front and rear, although initially three on the front tires in the first year, that ran through the entire circumference of the tire. The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and to produce racing similar to rain conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between tire and track. This, according to the FIA, was to promote driver skill and provide a better spectacle. Results have been mixed as the lack of mechanical grip has resulted in the more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip which in turn has resulted in', "How much money do I have available to start my garden? What is the main purpose for my garden? You need to look at all of these factors and weigh them against the available gardening options. You can look at the various types of gardening, and start by marking off the ones you're not interested in. Then you can eliminate those that would be impractical or impossible for you to take on. Then you can look at your remaining options and decide which one you'd prefer to try. Of course, you don't have to be confined to a single choice.", "The internet has been especially helpful in causing audiobook sales to climb to the top of the charts. Web sites abound that offer audiobooks, some read by fans rather than professionals. Since their inception, children's audiobooks have been instrumental in teaching children to read. Now, these same children have grown up and are using audiobooks in college. It's a way to increase the number of books they read on a subject and also increases their comprehension of the books. Audiobooks have always been indispensable to the blind. Now, magazine publications are making their monthly offerings available in audiobook format and", "Building a bond of love and trust is very important for both you and your child, and you have several ways to create that secure bond very early in your precious child's life. When you decide to use early learning in your parenting, you are doing more than just helping your child understand the world around him sooner. You are also forging a bond that's based on the learning experience you provide. This experience can carry on throughout the child's developmental years, and even into adulthood in some cases. Many young adults are close to their parents and enjoy doing", 'Short boards, which typically range in size from 5 to 8 feet in length, are known more for their performance capabilities and are geared more for the experienced surfer. They allow for quick, powerful turns and very tight maneuverability. The thickness of a short board is generally only a few inches, which makes learning on a short board very difficult. The nose and tail of a surfboard vary as well. Pointed noses are more common in short boards as opposed to a more rounded nose, which is common in longer surfboards. A pointed nose will make it easier when dropping', 'One of the toughest challenges for a runner is finding the time to fit a run into a full daily schedule. For a lot of runners the answer is to run in the morning before the day starts. This inevitably means getting yourself out of bed and out onto the street while the rest of the world is still sleeping. To some people this seems like madness, and the idea of having to exercising in the early hours is enough to make them quit running for good but it might be the answer to your run scheduling nightmares. The first', "Let's face it, with the right lighting, filters, and digital adjustments, it does not take a huge effort to shoot snow for catalogs, magazines, and commercials. But with the widespread use of instant snow made from powder, the artificial snow in your shoot may be the most realistic and dramatic element. Fake snow that looks fake, blows around and wastes your valuable time is now a thing of the past. Originally developed for indoor snowboard parks in Japan, instant snow is so realistic that your crew will be arguing about who gets to take it home at the end of", "Some rainbows are missing a few colors. When the sun is low in the sky, those colorful arcs may contain only a fraction of the traditional red to violet hues. Or that's what researchers reported. Rainbows emerge as sunlight bends while passing through water droplets in the air. The water acts like a prism. It bends different parts of the light spectrum or colors by different amounts. This breaks the rainbow's light into bands of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. What results is a vibrant and colorful arc. But sometimes a rainbow will be short a few", "The dog is one of the most popular pets in the world. Its loyalty and devotion are legendary, and because of this the dog has been called man's best friend. Class distinctions between people have no part in a dog's life. It can be a faithful companion to either rich or poor. Dogs have been domesticated for most of human history and have thus endeared themselves to many over the years. A dog fits easily into family life. It thrives on praise and affection. When a master tells a dog that it is good, the animal happily wags its tail.", "Just like a city with hallways and roads, your body has blood vessels, arteries and veins that help move things around. Most of the cells inside of your body do not move. If a cell is hungry or needs to get rid of waste, it can't simply move itself to the part of your body where it needs to go. Instead, your body must bring the food to your cells and take the waste away from them. Using billions of tiny tubes, your body is constantly pumping blood throughout your body. On the way out, your blood is loaded with", "Language is a system that people use to communicate, or share information. Language includes speaking, writing, and making gestures, or body movements. Early human ancestors began using spoken language several million years ago. Language made it possible for human societies to develop. Humans are born with the ability to understand language. Without any special training, children learn to speak by listening to other people's speech. Other forms of language, such as writing and sign language, must be taught.", 'As this matter collides with the surrounding interstellar gas, it creates a relativistic shock wave that then propagates forward into interstellar space. A second shock wave, the reverse shock, may propagate back into the ejected matter. Extremely energetic electrons within the shock wave are accelerated by strong local magnetic fields and radiate as synchrotron emission across most of the electromagnetic spectrum. This model has generally been successful in modeling the behavior of many observed afterglows at late times, generally hours to days after the explosion, although there are difficulties explaining all features of the afterglow very shortly after the gamma', "Books written especially for children are called children's literature. Children's literature includes stories, fairy tales, fables, poems, and novels. It also includes nonfiction works on history, science, and other subjects. Children's literature can come in the form of picture books or chapter books. Picture books usually have a smaller amount of text, or words, and pictures on every page. They are written for younger readers. Chapter books have few or no pictures and much more text, which is divided into sections called chapters. Chapter books are written for older children.", "Studies conducted in Alzheimer's patients showed that providing dog therapy for one hour a day for four consecutive days reduced the apathy that the patients had for their lives. And other pet therapy, such as the use of aquariums, was shown to increase appetite and reduce aggression in patients with dementia. Animals of all sorts provide health benefits, not just domesticated pets. A 10 year old boy with cerebral palsy was allowed to interact with a tame elephant over a period of time. The biological response to these episodes was an improved outlook on life and a chemical change in", 'The crested gecko also has a special feature. Its head is shaped like a triangle. Long ridges run from its eyes down its back. As the gecko pushes through leaves and dirt, the ridges may help protect its eyes. Today, geckos have spread out from their original habitats.

When soda companies add carbon dioxide gas to a soda mixture, the water is very cold so it can hold a lot of gas. They also use pressure to put more gas in the water than it could normally hold at that temperature. But when a soda can warms up a bit or when the can is shaken, that extra gas is really ready to come out. Why does soda bubble so much when you pour it on ice cream to make an ice cream soda? Ice cream', "Have you ever considered recruiting your pet to join you in your exercise program? Pets can actually help you stay motivated and stick with an exercise regimen if you bring them along the next time you jog, walk or even use the treadmill. We all know that exercising isn't exactly the most fun part of a diet program. Exercising can seem like work and it's hard to get motivated enough to start. Dogs are good companions for jogs and long walks. They like to get out and see the world and smell the fresh air. They make good cohorts for", 'The most basic part of language is a sound. Sounds can be combined into words, words can be combined into sentences, and so on. Every language has several types of words. The most basic types of words are nouns and verbs. Nouns represent people, places, things, and ideas. Verbs describe action. Every language has its own rules of grammar as well. These rules control the order of words in a sentence. The order of the words gives the sentence meaning. Not all languages are spoken. In sign language, hand movements stand for letters, words, and sentences. Many people who use', "Before sweet spot finders were invented, golfers had to rely on their superstitions and guesswork to hope they hit the perfect point and end up with the best shot their swing could deliver. Golfers routinely blame a missed shot on the fact that they didn't hit the sweet spot. Some use this phrase to mean the sweet spot of a golf club, but others know there's a science involved in hitting the right point on a golf ball, also known as a sweet spot. Most sweet spot finders look similar to a miniature version of a ball washer. There's a", 'The police have many tasks. Most police officers patrol in cars. But sometimes they patrol on foot, on horseback, on motorcycles, or on bicycles. Second, police go to the scenes of crimes and emergencies to catch criminals and to help victims. Third, police investigate, or study, crimes to find out who committed them. One of the most serious is terrorism. Some police officers wear uniforms. Others work in everyday clothing, called plain clothes. Many police officers carry handcuffs, a notebook, and a two-way radio. Some also carry a handgun. Some use a stun gun or pepper spray to stop criminals', 'All animals need oxygen to stay alive. When they breathe in air, the oxygen in the air combines with the elements carbon and hydrogen in the body. This releases energy that the animals use to survive. The animals then breathe out a compound of carbon and oxygen called carbon dioxide. Plants take in that carbon dioxide as part of a process called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis plants break carbon dioxide back down into carbon and oxygen. They use the carbon and release the oxygen for animals to breathe in again. Many other common natural processes also occur when oxygen reacts with', 'Shelters are what people and animals use to protect themselves from their surroundings. Shelters can keep living things safe from the weather, predators, and other dangers. Animals such as foxes, moles, and meerkats burrow into the ground. Most birds build nests on the ground, in trees, or on the sides of cliffs. Bees also build nests. These can be found in trees or in the ground. Beavers build lodges made of tree branches and mud that protect them from the elements and predators. Most animals find shelter in some way or another. Over time, humans learned that they could use', 'If poison dart frogs are what they eat, then the colorful amphibians are definitely poison. A toxin is a poisonous substance produced by a living thing. Certain species of plants, fungi and animals may produce toxins. So can bacteria. When a toxin is injected, through a bite, sting or other means, it is called venom. Poison dart frogs absorb toxins from the ants, millipedes, beetles and mites that they eat. The frogs then secrete those toxins from their skin. That protects them from getting eaten. Some of these rainforest frogs are so toxic that just touching them can bring death.', "Defend against identity theft by reporting it as soon as you suspect a problem. Correcting the problem can be a long and detailed process and the sooner you get started the sooner the crime will be solved and hopefully the criminal punished.

For instance, it is only really the multi platinum selling musicians that get to play their music to packed stadiums, or the brightest artistic talents who get their work into the most famous of galleries. Those who still love their professions but aren't at the top of their game yet will find it very difficult to express their talents to a large audience. This is very different for gamers, thanks to the phenomenon", "Not all dog owners will find that the particular breed they're raising is suitable for dog agility training. Sometimes it's the breed, but other times it's the puppy itself who must be assessed for agility potential. Each puppy will have a different temperament within the litter. If you're considering purchasing a puppy based on its ability to train for agility, then you'll want to do more than focus on one puppy test. It often takes multiple tests to determine if a puppy has it in him to succeed with agility training. Testing for a puppy's agility training potential has to", "Rock gardens are a type of garden with an emphasis on rocks and stones with a few small plants that are found in naturally rocky areas. The plants are generally small and de-emphasized but are vital to help in the aesthetics. Because the plants are native to rocky areas, they'll be small and like their soil to be drier than most plants but can't completely be without water. A popular type of rock garden is where bedrock is arranged to imply there was a bedding plane that had shifted or had come up partially above the ground. Plants are arranged", 'The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining the outcome of races more than driver skill, banned many such aids for 1994. This resulted in cars that were previously dependent on electronic aids becoming very twitchy and difficult to drive, and many observers felt the ban on driver aids was in name only as they have proved difficult to police effectively. The teams signed a second concorde agreement during 1992 and a third in 1997, which expired on the last day of 2007. On the track, the McLaren and Williams teams dominated the 1980s and 1990s, with Brabham also', 'Imagine a giant skyscraper reaching up into the sky. Up at the very top there are hundreds of workers busy doing their jobs. No matter what the weather is like outside, these workers feel safe, because they know that the building was built very strong. Even on windy days, the building will not fall over. What gives buildings their super strength? The secret is in their bones. Well, sort of. Buildings are built around a steel framework. This framework holds the weight and allows the builders to go as high as they want. Your body is similar to a skyscraper.', 'Simple machines can be combined to create compound machines. Compound machines can be as small as a mechanical watch or as large as a construction crane. Some, such as a car, contain thousands of parts. In a compound machine, forces and motion are transferred from one part to another. One way this is done is with gears. A gear is typically a circular piece of metal with teeth, or ridges, along its outer edge. The teeth of one gear fit into those of another. When one gear turns, it also turns the other gear. Another way of transferring forces and', 'Ancient people left fresh meat, fruits, and vegetables in the sun and wind to remove moisture. The dried food did not spoil as quickly. This is because the microorganisms inside food need water to grow. Today people often use machines in factories to dry food. Fruits, vegetables, milk, potatoes, soup mixes, and meats may be processed this way. Meats and fish are sometimes dried by smoking. The meat is hung or placed on racks in a room that contains smoke from a hardwood fire. The meat may be smoked for a few hours or several days, depending on the type', 'In 1848, a man saw flecks of gold in a stream in California. The tiny flecks changed the United States forever. Gold fever took over the country. Tens of thousands of Americans dropped everything and headed west in search of fortune. They left their families.

Sugar continues to be an important ingredient in jams, jellies, and marmalades. Vinegar and salt have long been used to pickle vegetables and meat. The process of curing meat may use some combination of salt, sugar, vinegar, nitrite, and nitrate. Ascorbic acid, or vitamin C, is often added to sliced apples and peaches to keep them from turning brown. Canning is a process that uses heat to kill microorganisms in food. The heated', 'A dome headed dinosaur skull found in southern Alberta is helping scientists rethink some of their ideas about dinosaurs. The skull was found in 2008 by a team of scientists led by Dr. David Evans of the Royal Ontario Museum. The skull is about 85 million years old. The top of the skull is made of a dome shaped mass of solid bone about 10 centimeters thick. This means the dinosaur belonged to a group of dinosaurs called pachycephalosaurs (thick headed lizards). The scientists compared the skull to all of the known pachycephalosaur specimens in the world. They learned that', 'However, if they were too large, movement would be awkward. Very small, thin bones would allow you to move, jump and play, but are much more likely to break. The solution is an amazing biological mix of medium sized, very strong, yet lightweight bones. What makes your bones so light, yet also very strong? The secret is in the chemicals. Your bones are made out of several very hard, yet lightweight chemicals. In order to keep your bones healthy, you need to make sure your body gets plenty of these chemicals. The most important of these is calcium. One very', 'The mineral part of soil forms from rocks. Such forces as wind, water, and temperature changes break rocks down into tiny particles, or bits. The smallest particles are called clay. Medium-sized particles are called silt. The largest particles are called sand. Different types of soil contain different mixtures of clay, silt, and sand. The organic part of soil forms when plants and animals die. Their bodies decay, or break down, and mix with the rock particles. The organic material, called humus, helps to form the pores in the soil. It keeps the soil soft and loose. Humus also provides the', "The type of garden you choose will depend on several factors. If you live in an apartment, it may be impossible for you to have a large vegetable garden, no matter how much you may desire one. If you work 60 hours per week, caring for a very large rose garden might be a little too much to handle. If you're confined to a wheelchair, taking care of a complex outdoor garden might be a bit beyond your capabilities. Ask yourself these questions: How much space do I have available for gardening? How much time do I have to care", "Temperature measures the average motion of atoms and molecules in a material. A higher temperature indicates that atoms and molecules have more energy. They also are moving or vibrating faster. To understand how temperature affects electrical resistance, consider the two types of charged particles inside an atom: negatively charged electrons, whose motion generates current; and positively charged protons, which are eighteen hundred times heavier. Because electrons are much lighter, they don't require as much energy to move. It takes a lot more energy, or heat, to get protons moving.

Certain diseases or medical conditions can be greatly improved through the use of Tai Chi. If you have high blood pressure, for instance, Tai Chi can help stabilize it to more normal levels. It's also beneficial in giving your immune system a much needed boost. Tai Chi is more a way of life than an exercise. Traditional exercises are for building muscles, increasing blood flow and burning calories. Tai Chi does that, too, but it also does so much more.

There the males stand, for about 65 days, through icy temperatures, cruel winds, and blinding storms. And they eat nothing that whole time. Finally, the females return from the sea, bringing food they regurgitate to feed the now hatched chicks. The males eagerly leave for their own fishing session at sea. The youngsters stay sheltered in their mother's brood pouch for two months. If a young chick falls out, it", 'Astronomers study the universe in different ways. Some are professionals, meaning that they make their living at the work. Others study objects in space as a hobby. They are known as amateur astronomers. Some astronomers work in laboratories. There they study actual samples of objects that have been collected by spacecraft. These include meteorites, rock samples from the moon, and dust particles. Many astronomers observe distant objects with the help of telescopes. Telescopes range in size. Some are small enough to be carried by hand. Large telescopes are often housed in buildings known as observatories.', "Rain is a part of Earth's endless water cycle. At the beginning of the cycle, sunlight heats up water on Earth's surface. The heat causes the water to evaporate, or to turn into water vapor. This water vapor rises into the air. As the water vapor cools, it turns back into water, in the form of droplets. The droplets form around dust and other particles through a process called condensation. Clouds form from large numbers of these droplets. In a cloud, droplets come together with other droplets to form larger drops of water. Eventually, the drops become too heavy to", "Dog agility is gaining speed as one of Europe and America's best animal sports.

Either one worked just as well, as long as you were only communicating with people from the same country. But what happens as technologies improve, and travelers begin interacting with people from many different lands? If each country is using a different prime meridian to mark 0 degrees longitude, then it would be impossible to give someone from another country a location, and have them be able to accurately find it.', "Prisoners have also been given the responsibility of pet ownership to help cultivate a sense of caring and method of coping with depression. When given a cat to care for in the confinement of the prison, the inmates who took part in the program reported an increase in self esteem.

It may be that we feel comfortable trusting an animal that isn't judgmental with us. Whether it's to boost your", "A gecko can see colors in the dark, which few living creatures can do. A nocturnal gecko's eye structure is different from that of other lizards. Most vertebrates have two kinds of cells in their eyes that sense light. These are called rods and cones. Rods pick up only black and white. Cones detect colors, but only when there's lots of light. Lizards do not have rods, only cones. Geckos that come out at night have three kinds of super size cones. These cones give nocturnal geckos their super color vision. It's important for a gecko to protect its eyesight.", "Scientists announced that they have succeeded in detecting gravitational waves from the violent merging of two black holes in deep space. So let's mull gravity and why it's been such a mysterious force for so long. Gravity is invisible, as you may have noticed, and a little bit spooky, because it seems to reach across space to cause actions at a distance without any obvious underlying mechanism. What goes up must come down, but why that is so has never been obvious. Physicists tell us there are four fundamental forces in the universe, gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force and", "Scientists are finding ways to adapt compounds that frogs and other animals rely on for protection against threats in their environment. These compounds can be put to use fighting pests that threaten human health, the environment and the food supply. Frog poisons, for instance, can be used to fight insects such as the mosquito. Already, some of these natural compounds are being enlisted to guard human health and safety. Throughout nature, one organism's defense can become another's offense and vice versa. Some scientists look at poisons not as a source of fear but as a raw material for drugs and", 'Out of all of the Beatles, Paul was probably the most prolific of them all, and that can be witnessed just by combing through the Beatles discography, and noticing just how many songs that Paul either wrote or cowrote in the years between the Beatles first album in 1962 to their breakup in 1970. Besides being the cute one, he also stood out from the other three in the fact that he liked to be where the action was. After the Beatles catapulted to fame, all of the other members moved away to the countryside of southern England to live', "Despite being coached to choose healthy foods, the stressed men proved more likely to pick the less healthy option. The researchers also performed brain scans of the volunteers. It showed what part of the brain was active as they made their choices. Our findings indicate that stress biases the decision process. And it does this, they explain, by altering two brain pathways. One of the affected sets of circuits relays sensory information, such as taste. The other affects a person's ability to set goals and make decisions to follow through on those goals such as eating what is good for", "The development of electricity has resulted in the total transformation of civilization. It brings power into homes to operate lights, kitchen appliances, television sets, radios, furnaces, computers, garage doors, and more. So common are its uses that one cannot imagine today's world without it. Streets would not be lit. Telephones would not work. Storefronts and factories would be dimmed. Electrical forces are also responsible for holding body cells together in the shape they have. In fact, electrical forces are fundamental in holding all matter together.

Nuclear fission happens when the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more parts. Nuclear fusion happens when two nuclei join to form a single nucleus. The nuclei of certain kinds of atoms can give off nuclear energy without fission or fusion taking place. These atoms are called radioactive. Nuclear fusion happens naturally in stars such as the sun. There atoms are constantly combining and creating nuclear energy. That energy is the source of the heat and light that Earth gets from the sun.', 'On that day, the declaration was read aloud, city bells rang, and bands played.

Each ear is divided into three parts, the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The three parts work together so you can hear sound. Hearing starts at the outer ear, which carries sound from the air through the ear canal to the eardrum. The eardrum vibrates, which causes three bones in the middle', "If you're a tea drinker, you may have come across many different flavors of tea lining the aisles of the grocery store. You may even have seen and tried green tea in your taste testing endeavors. You may have noticed that it held a nice, gentle flavor, but did you know that it provides more than just flavor? It probably has the most health benefits of any kind of beverage or food item we know about. Green tea was developed centuries ago for the sole purpose of healing. The Chinese are the ones who first realized the benefits it holds", "For years, health enthusiasts have lived by the age old motto, an apple a day keeps the doctor away. While it's true that an apple provides ample vitamin C as well as antiallergenic, anti inflammatory, and antiviral benefits, there's an even more powerful fruit that contributes to your overall health. The amalaki tree, which is primarily found in the tropical areas of Asia, has been cultivated for centuries in gardens and has sprung up as a popular commercial crop that's grown for medicinal purposes. Amalaki is a fruit that really can keep the doctor away.", 'Many of the high end crossbows have a speed of more than 350 FPS, which means the bolt or arrow can travel through the air at more than 350 feet per second. Not only does this allow for increased accuracy and distance, but it also delivers more impact on contact. A high speed rating is probably the greatest and most desired aspect of a crossbow. For practicing and competition, the high velocity transfers the greatest precision. A high velocity means the arrow will arrive at the target faster. This usually means it will be less hindered by wind resistance and', "Hike through one of Iceland's many ancient lava fields. You might notice something strange. The ground in front of you is steaming. Plumes of white steam rise from the ground. Iceland is covered with steam vents and hot springs. The steam comes from naturally heated rocks and hot water below earth's surface. The most famous of Iceland's bubbling hot springs is Blue lagoon. It is not far from the country's capital city. You can visit the lagoon and soak in its soothing, milky blue waters. Minerals and white mud in the water make your skin as soft as a newborn", "In standard scoring with dog agility competitions, faults are still assessed a penalty. The winner is whoever has the shortest period of time with the fewest penalties. If there's a tie, then the fastest time wins. Time plus faults scoring is determined by speed. The score of the handler and dog in the agility competition is calculated by the actual time on the course plus penalties. So if the time score was 38.27 seconds on the course, but the dog incurred 9 penalties, then the score would be 47.27 seconds. In this case, the winner of the dog agility competition", "Carbon dioxide is a gas. So its molecules are spread out and can flow freely within a space. But when they get into the ocean, the molecules break apart. Now their parts get together with other molecules in the water to form new molecules. These carbon dioxide molecules can become part of new gases, liquids or solids. It's hard to imagine that such a small molecule as carbon dioxide has the potential to drastically change the ocean. Molecule by molecule, the effect of extra carbon dioxide is harmless. But on the grand scale taking place today, the effect is substantial", "Last on your getting started list for the family tree website should be to include a directory of family members. Gather the names, ages, and phone numbers of relatives that don't mind having their information within the account and assure them that you're guarding their information from the general public if you're managing the site yourself. Consider the building of your family tree website a potluck reunion of treasured relatives you haven't seen in years. Allow everyone to contribute to the mix and you'll soon find your genealogical research overflowing with valuable information that you can share with your own", 'In science, a crystal is a certain type of solid object. Scientists describe matter, or everything that can be seen, according to the way it is made. All matter is made up of tiny parts called atoms and molecules. If those parts are arranged in a regular pattern then the object is a crystal. On the outside crystals have a regular pattern of flat surfaces that meet in sharp corners. Most matter that is not alive is made up of crystals. Common substances such as sugar and salt are made of crystals. So are metals such as gold, silver, copper,', "When you begin the early learning process, you must commit yourself to the task of making it enjoyable for both you and the child. If the child isn't fully engaged in an activity, or she picks up on the fact that you're bored with it yourself, then the learning session will be over fairly quickly. The fine art of knowing when to stop is something that you must practice, erring on the side of caution. If you learn to stop before either of you have lost interest, you will be able to have the sessions longer next time, and have", "Many people suffer from sleeplessness, but what is insomnia? It's more than just being unable to sleep when it's time for bed. There are plenty of instances when someone who suffers from this condition can actually fall asleep, but they don't stay asleep. They drift into what's called a type of cat napping sleep. It can also be defined as being tired enough to sleep, but lying down and suddenly feeling wide awake. For people who wake up in the middle of the night and just can't get back to sleep no matter what efforts they try, that's also a", "Scientists do not know exactly why people get asthma. But once people have the condition, their bodies tend to overreact to certain things called triggers. The triggers vary from person to person. For some it may be exercising. For others, breathing polluted air or getting a cold may bring on an asthma attack. Asthma attacks are also often associated with allergies. Allergies are a body's negative reactions to certain substances. Things that cause allergic reactions may trigger asthma attacks, too. These things include plant pollen, mold, and tiny insects that live in house dust.", 'The quality of a garment is measured by how long it lasts, by its usefulness, and by its appeal to sight and touch. If a garment tears easily, it is not durable. If a cold weather topcoat does not keep its wearer warm, it is not useful. If a piece of clothing is coarse to the touch, it lacks appeal. There are, of course, other factors within these three categories that add to or detract from quality. Clothes should not shrink, fade, or lose their creases easily nor should they be readily combustible. Before materials can be sewed together to', 'Once you have your pile of organic material in place, nature will take care of the rest. Bacteria, insects and worms will work hard together to break your pile down into usable compost. If time is not a factor then you can literally let the pile sit there and it will eventually break down. However, if you want your compost a bit faster, there are a few things you can do to help speed things up. Use a yard shredder, chipper or your lawn mower, to break down larger items in very small pieces. The smaller the pieces, the quicker', "As with many of man's great achievements, it all began with the wine. In this case it was actually the glasses and their capacity to produce sound. Wet your fingers then rub them over the ridge of the goblet and a high pitched tone will fill the room at a loudness unexpected from such a gentle motion. It's a surprising sound. A clear pitch with a gentle vibrato that seems to surround you as the sound bounces off the walls of the room. The first time that musicians took advantage of the musical properties of glass bowls was in the", "Today, insects are part of traditional diets throughout much of the world. You don't even have to go to remote places like a rain forest to find bugs on the menu. In Mexico, you can buy grasshoppers by the bag. Just roast and wrap in a tortilla. At the movies in South America, the snack bar might serve roasted ants instead of popcorn. If you wander through a market in Thailand, you'll find bins of deep fried silkworms and water bugs. A handful makes a perfect snack. Even if you haven't been to these places, you may have eaten bugs,", "A 2006 study showed that dog owners got more exercise than those who didn't have a four legged friend. While you might think of it as a duty that you have as its owner, try to start thinking of Fido as your exercise buddy instead. Try to map out a schedule for when you'll walk the dog. Having a set routine is beneficial for both you and your pet. If you live in a climate that has its ups and downs with weather, try to take an indoor walk with your dog on the treadmill. No, you don't have to", 'If the water was too unpleasant, the volunteers could remove their hands, but must continue looking into a video camera. The men were also encouraged to put their hands back into the cold water. All the while, a researcher watched and videotaped the ordeals. Another group of men held one hand in warm water. They were not videotaped. Afterward, the researchers showed each man a series of two food items. They did this two hundred times. And before they started making their picks, the men were told to choose the healthier of the two items whenever possible. When the testing', 'If a city is twice as large as a neighboring town, an accurate scaled map will show the same relationship on paper. The drawn city will be twice as large as the drawn town. Because the earth is round and maps are flat, it is impossible to create a map with a perfect scale. Some parts of the map will be too large, while others will be too small. The larger a territory represented by a map, the greater that the distortions in scale will be. A map which depicts a small territory is referred to as a large scale', "Audiobooks aren't just for long trips anymore. The market has taken off since the 1980s when the publishing industry began to record its best sellers. Audiobook sales have steadily increased ever since that time. Now, audiobooks are attracting even more fans because of famous narrators lending their voices to read them. You can also easily download them into computers or digital players for future use and pleasure. The future looks bright for the audiobook industry with digital downloading capability and celebrities who take the time to promote a favorite book or author by placing their names on the jackets and", 'A few more eggs a week may not be so bad for you, but watch out for that sugary drink.

If there is life, the problems of living in foreign surroundings could range from harmless to deadly. If voyagers find a dead planetary body, then they will have to make it livable. Making it livable will take centuries. Meanwhile, the ark would have to continue to work without failures. Overall, there are many problems with traveling through space in an ark. There are other problems with trying to live on another planet. While it is not impossible, the project would have very poor chances of success.', "Brain scans performed at age 18 also showed differences if a girl's preschool age saliva had showed high stress hormone levels. Two brain parts usually collaborate to help a person deal with negative emotions. But in the girls who'd had high levels of cortisol as children, these two brain regions, called the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala, failed to coordinate. And girls with weaker connections between the two brain regions had more problems with anxiety than girls with stronger connections. Burghy's team doesn't know why boys didn't show the same problem.", "The year 2016 may go down in history as one of the best years for people to stick to their New Year's resolutions. These are the promises people make to themselves at the beginning of the year to lose weight, save money, stop smoking, etc. Research shows that around half of all adults make New Year's resolutions but fewer than 10 percent of them keep to these promises. Many people make goals at the beginning of January but have given up by February. The main reason people do not stick to their resolutions is because they are too unrealistic.

Like many other life forms, animals are multicellular. These cells come together, forming tissues, organs and organ systems, that help sustain the life of the animal. From elephants to snails, animals come in many shapes and sizes, and can be found all over the world. Animals cannot make their own food. They must rely on other living things, such as plants, fungi, and other animals to sustain them. Without other food', 'Painting with the fingers is a simple form of creative expression. It was originally intended as a means of developing the imaginative and artistic powers of young children. It has become a hobby for people of all ages. No art training is required; there is no technique to master. Working with the fingertips and with one or both hands and arms, the artist simply gives free rein to fancy. A kind of spontaneous rhythm develops, gradually achieving abstract form. Finger painting lends itself best to ideas that are abstract, to the decorative, and to the imaginative.', 'Caterpillars are the prey of many birds and insects. To avoid attacks, they have natural protections. Some caterpillars are colored to blend into their surroundings. Others have showy dots or stripes on their bodies that make them look fierce or very large. A few give off unpleasant smells, and a small number grow poisonous hair. A caterpillar hatches from the egg laid by a female butterfly or moth. It grows quickly and soon becomes too large for its skin. The skin splits and the caterpillar wiggles out. This process, called molting, occurs four or five times before a caterpillar turns', 'What could be cooler than creating a pencil drawing of someone you love and having everyone know exactly who it is? If you can follow basic instructions and are willing to practice, you can learn how to draw cool drawings like realistic portraits. Even if you are just a budding artist and are pretty sure you have no skills, even if you have tried to draw cool drawings before and failed, learning some basic techniques will turn it all around for you.

Schumacher retired at the end of 2006 after sixteen years in formula one, but came out of retirement for the 2010 season, racing for the newly formed mercedes GP. During this period the championship rules were changed frequently by the FIA with the intention of improving the on track action and cutting costs. Team orders, legal since the championship started during 1950, were banned during 2002 after several incidents in which teams openly manipulated race results, generating negative publicity, most famously by Ferrari at the 2002 Austrian grand prix.', 'Smooth muscle helps to move food through the digestive system. It lines the intestines and the stomach. Smooth muscle also moves the diaphragm, which helps with breathing. Smooth muscle makes blood vessels tighten and relax, too. Like cardiac muscle, smooth muscle is involuntary muscle. The nervous system and body chemicals control the actions of smooth muscle. Using skeletal muscle too much during work or exercise can cause pain. If a muscle stretches too far, it can tear. This is called a muscle strain, or a pulled muscle. Skeletal muscle can also cramp or twitch. Muscular dystrophy is a disease that', 'All living things can move, using their own energy. Even though plants stay in one spot, they move their leaves to get sunlight. Living things are also sensitive, or able to feel. The simplest life forms can feel only when they are touched, or they have only a sense of hot and cold. Living things take in and release certain chemicals. Animals breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. Green plants take in carbon dioxide through their leaves and release oxygen. All organisms need the nutrients and energy that food gives.

It is key to remember that even though you are playing a game it is imperative that you prepare to play paintball, even basic paintball, using quality guns', 'Caves are the home of many different animals. Some, such as bats, live in caves but come out at night to feed. Other cave dwelling animals live their entire lives underground. Without light, they are usually white or transparent and do not have eyes. Blind animals found in caves include many different insects and spiders, types of shrimp, and some salamanders. Animals that live in caves have special characteristics to help them survive. Those characteristics are called adaptations. Cave animals may not have sight, but their other senses are highly developed. For example, insects that live in caves usually have', "One beam might be twisted in one direction. Another might be twisted in a different direction. Yet another may have more twists. Imagine you lined up 100 shoelaces. If they were all flat, they'd look the same and it would be hard to tell them apart. But if you gave each one its own special twist, you could always tell them apart. The researchers sent light beams with different amounts of twist sailing through the new fiber. They then tested different colored light beams twisted in one of two ways.

Talk to one of the experts and you may find that creating that perfect winter wonderland look is much easier than you think, and you may find yourself recommending snow scenes to more and', 'Dilophosaurus takes its name from its most unusual feature its rounded double crest. But it had other odd features. Its jawbones were not strongly connected. There was a gap behind its forward teeth. And its teeth had a narrow base. So they might have broken off more easily in feeding than the teeth of other big meat eaters. Some scientists think that with all of these features, they could only have eaten fish or already dead animals. Others disagree and believe that they were capable hunters, able to take on the biggest plant eaters of its time, the prosauropods.', 'Online trading has enabled investors to have increasing accessibility to the currency exchanges and has resulted in several trillion trades each day.

Learning how to surf on a fun shape board is also easier than learning how to surf on a short board. Another element of long boards and fun shape boards, which make them ideal for beginners, is that manufacturers can make these boards soft with a foam top, instead of a fiberglass. These are called soft boards. While these softboards are still very strong and durable, the primary benefit is the safety", "Humans have long been fascinated by the concept of invisibility. Fans of fiction have pondered what one would do if one could move about unseen. Invisibility is often portrayed as a perfect transparency however this method is in conflict with the laws of nature as we understand them. Moreover, a transparent person would be plagued with a host of difficulties that seem quite insurmountable.

The major elements of a play, or drama, include the characters and the plot. The characters, or the people in the story, often come into conflict with each other over something. For example, they may desire the same", 'The process that scientists use to solve problems is called the scientific method. Scientists start by finding out as much as possible about a problem. Then they make a hypothesis. A hypothesis is an attempt to explain the problem. They test the hypothesis with an experiment. If the experiment does not support the hypothesis, the scientists think about the problem again and develop a new hypothesis. They then test that hypothesis with a new experiment. If the experiment supports the hypothesis, other scientists repeat the experiment to make sure that they get the same results. If they do get the', 'Many optical illusions, or illusions that are seen, happen because of the way light behaves. Light travels at different speeds in different substances. It refracts, or bends, as it passes through one substance to another. For example, a ray of light is refracted as it moves from water to air. Therefore a straw standing in water seems broken at the surface where the air and water meet. Mirages and rainbows are also caused by the way light travels. Sounds also travel in ways that affect how they are heard. The siren on an ambulance has a different pitch when it', "Longships were sea vessels made and used by the Vikings from the Nordic countries for trade, commerce, exploration, and warfare during the Viking Age. The longship's design evolved over many years, beginning in the stone age with the invention of the Umiak and continuing up to the 9th century with the Nydam and Kvalsund ships. The longship appeared in its complete form between the 9th and 13th centuries. The character and appearance of these ships have been reflected in Scandinavian boat building traditions until today. The longship is characterized as a graceful, long, narrow, light, wooden boat with a shallow", "Insects are good for you in other ways, too. Grasshoppers are low in fat. Water bugs, three inch long bugs that look a lot like cockroaches, are high in iron which is good for your blood. Termites are a good source of magnesium, which helps muscles, nerves, hearts, and bones work. Bugs have another advantage. There are lots of them. For each human on earth, there are hundreds of millions of insects! If you're hungry, you can probably find an insect nearby. They live just about everywhere. Many insects live in big groups. In rain forests, eight million leaf cutter", "When it comes to dropping pounds, most people go about it precisely the wrong way. They underestimate the importance of diet, and overestimate the power of cardio. Jogging, bike riding not to be confused with cycling, and other low intensity exercises can benefit your heart, lungs, and mood, but they're the scenic routes to a smaller waist. To burn fat, you need a smart, nutrient dense diet and a workout program that's packed with exercises that target as many muscle groups as possible. So step away from the treadmill and watch the fat melt away.", "The hatchling leaves the nest with many other baby turtles. It heads downhill, toward the horizon. Turtles are drawn to the moonlight reflecting off the ocean. Luckily, there are no lights shining from a nearby street or house. These lights can confuse a baby turtle. They can make it go the wrong way, away from the sea. The hatchling's journey to the water is a race for survival. It is no bigger than a walnut. Crabs and night herons snatch up some of the other hatchlings on the beach. The frothy surf pushes it back but she fights to swim", 'Every organism, or living thing, is made up of structures called cells. The cell is the smallest unit with the basic properties of life. Some tiny organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, consist of only one cell. Large plants and animals have many billions of cells. Human beings are made up of more than seventy five trillion cells. The study of cells is a branch of biology. Cells exist in a variety of shapes and sizes. For example, they may be cube shaped or disk shaped. Most cells are very small. For example, about ten thousand human cells could fit', "Astronomers believe the rings formed from bits of asteroids and comets that shattered before they reached the planet. Swoop low over the atmosphere and you might watch two of the planet's moons rise within gaps in the rings. You couldn't watch this moonrise from the planet's surface, though. Saturn is a ball of mostly hydrogen and helium more than seven hundred and fifty times the size of our planet. Its yellow color comes from ammonia crystals in the upper atmosphere, which is home to electrical storms the size of our country. Steer clear of those lightning strikes. They're a thousand", "When you've successfully reached a hypnotic state, you or a hypnosis specialist can plant alternative thoughts into your subconscious to help change your thinking patterns. Hypnosis is not something that will cure your problem in one session. It's something that takes place over several sessions in order to become successful, even though many people report feeling different or better after just one session. You need to be open minded to the process in order for it to work. If you go in with too many doubts, it either won't be successful, or will take longer to achieve the kind of", 'Evaporation and condensation are two processes through which matter changes from one state to another. Matter can exist in three different states. Solid, liquid, or gas. In evaporation, matter changes from a liquid to a gas. In condensation, matter changes from a gas to a liquid. All matter is made of tiny moving particles called molecules. Evaporation and condensation happen when these molecules gain or lose energy in the form of heat. As the sun heats water in a puddle, the puddle slowly shrinks. In a similar way, as water in a pot boils, the level of the water falls.', "Women have to pay a lot more in stores than men for almost the same things. A new study found that many products for women cost up to twice as much as similar products for men. Researchers looked at hundreds of goods. They found that women's clothes and beauty products and girls toys were on average thirty six percent more expensive than products for men and boys. One store charged over seven dollars more for a pink scooter aimed at girls than a black one. Another store charged double the price for ten razors simply because they were pink. Researchers", 'Board games provide a fun way to bring the family together, but they can also help develop academic skills. Parents who want to bring the family together and help their children move forward with their education without being too pushy about it can choose from a number of games based on the skills they are trying to develop. Monopoly is a tried and true family favorite. Not only is it a fun game to play, but the whole family gets to brush up on their math skills while they try to manage money, develop groups of property, and try to', "After the steaks, chops, breasts, ribs, thighs, hams, tenderloins and briskets are removed, there's a fair amount of gristle, fat and offal remaining on a butchered animal, and early on, people realized this could be put to good use. One of these products is the hot dog, a classic of pre cooked, processed meat. Because of the butchering process, the leftovers used in products like hot dogs often have a fair amount of bacteria, and so pre cooking helps eliminate that. In addition, pre cooking has the added benefit of helping to separate the remaining muscle meat, fat and connective", 'The armed martial arts historically included archery and fighting with swords or spears. The martial art called ninjutsu used a wide variety of weapons. Ninjutsu is a Japanese word that means fighting methods of the ninja. The ninja were a secret group of highly trained martial artists. They were spies and fighters for Japanese rulers known as warlords. The ninja used such weapons as blowguns with poisoned darts, brass knuckles, and throwing devices. In modern times versions of the armed martial arts are practiced as sports. The sport called kendo developed from the fighting methods of the samurai. Opponents in', "The monster flower is a parasite. It depends on vines of another type of plant for survival. The flower develops from a seed that falls into cracks in the woody vines. A bud grows inside the vines until it is large enough to break through the vine's bark. The flower then blooms. Its rotten odor attracts flies, which carry the flower's pollen between plants. Animals eat the flower's fruits and spread its seeds. The flower lives for only about a week. The monster flower and other rafflesias are rare. Tourism, farming, and road building have disturbed some of their habitats.", 'There are many family games out there that bring loads of fun to all members of the family, young or old. Many families love to play card games. Others get hours of fun playing classic board games for all the family. One of the best ways to spend a few hours with your family is to play a board game. One of the benefits to board games is that there are games to suit all tastes. The earliest known board games are thousands of years old and were found in the tombs of ancient egyptians. Every society and civilization has', 'Humans have been around for hundreds of thousands of years. Yet think back just a decade or two. Computers were clunky; the internet was in its infancy; there was no Facebook, no Google, no YouTube, no Wikipedia. If you wanted to find out where a place was, or the definition of a word, you had to walk to the bookshelf and look it up in a physical a to z or dictionary. And now the internet is mobile, available on your smartphone wherever you happen to be. The internet has reshaped virtually every industry, transformed the way business is done', "The free passenger balloon is nearly always spherical or pear shaped. The huge bag is made of cloth coated with rubber or some other substance to make it leakproof. It is filled through a sleeve like opening at the bottom, called the neck or appendix. The entire bag is enclosed in a strong net to which the passenger basket is attached. At the top of the bag is a valve for releasing gas. This is connected to a cord that usually runs through the envelope and out the appendix, hanging within a balloonist's reach. Bags of sand are hung around", "There are manufacturers who are now making faux diamonds that have the same enduring quality a real diamond has. They have the same characteristics, all the way down to the cut and clarity. The only real way to tell which is an imitation diamond and which is real, is by taking it to a professional jeweler who will study them. The faux diamonds have the same expensive look to them, but they're really cheaper in price. The cost of faux diamond jewelry is not as cheap as the $20 rings we used to see with bands that turn your finger", "Different kinds of feathers have different purposes. Straight, stiff feathers give birds their ability to fly. Tail feathers help with steering, balance, and braking. Small, fluffy feathers, called down, keep a bird's body from getting too cold and its skin from getting wet. People in many cultures also use feathers. They decorate hats, clothing, and jewelry with colorful feathers. They fill clothing, pillows, and comforters with down for softness and warmth. Some governments protect rare birds from hunters who would kill them for their feathers.", "A battleship is a large armored warship with a main battery consisting of heavy caliber guns. Battleships were larger, better armed and armored than cruisers and destroyers. As the largest armed ships in a fleet, battleships were used to attain command of the sea and represented the apex of a nation's naval power from about 1875 up until World War II. With the rise of air power, guided missiles, and guided bombs, large guns were no longer deemed necessary to establish naval superiority. Battleship design evolved to incorporate and adapt technological advances to maintain an edge.", "Candy, in most cases, contains quite a bit of sugar. Sugar will give you a temporary boost of energy, but it gives you too much at one time, resulting in a quick crash shortly after. Once the sugar high wears off, your mood can be irritable from the overwhelming fatigue it brings. If the sweet treats can't be avoided, go for sugarless options or treats with a much smaller amount of sugar. Potato chips are another stress inducing snack item. Most potato chips contain a lot of salt, which can make you dehydrated and retain water.", "All living things need water to survive and that includes plants. In some plants, roots suck up water from the ground. In other plants, leaves and stems take in water. On a hot summer day a thirsty birch tree can sop up 80 gallons of water from the ground. That tree can then release almost the same amount into the air as water vapor. In dry places, plants must make every drop count. A desert cactus' leaves store water. Some plants become dormant during extremely dry times. When rain finally falls, they burst back to life in an explosion of", "Travel up the Missouri river in the past was difficult and exhausting due to heat, injuries and insects as well as the troublesome river itself, with its strong current and many snags. The expedition used Lewis' fifty five foot long keelboat and two smaller boats called pirogues to carry their supplies and equipment. The boats used sails to move along, but in going upriver against a strong current, oars and long poles were used to push the boats. Sometimes the boats had to be pulled upriver with ropes by men walking along the shoreline. They averaged ten to fifteen miles", "Auroras are dazzling displays of colored light that sometimes appear in the night sky. They occur in Earth's far northern and far southern regions. In the Northern Hemisphere such a display is known as aurora borealis, or the northern lights. In the Southern Hemisphere, it is called aurora australis, or the southern lights. Auroras are named after Aurora, the ancient Roman goddess of the dawn. Auroras take many shapes and forms, with arcs and rays of colored light being the most common. The light may also look like shimmering curtains, bands, waves, or clouds. An aurora constantly changes shape as", 'Ants have been farming for upwards of fifty five million years. Humans started farming about twelve thousand years ago. Ants got a huge head start when it comes to growing food. They were developing their agricultural techniques for millions of years while we were nonexistent and then roaming around scrabbling for food. It is no wonder, then, that we find highly developed agriculture systems in some ant species. At the top of farming abilities are the famous leaf cutter ants. They cultivate fungus gardens as a unique food for their colony. Like us, they prepare soil, leaf cuttings, plant, weed,', 'Most snakes move by pushing the scales on the underside of their body against the ground. The body moves in a series of S shaped loops. Some large snakes, such as the boas, move in a straight line. They inch their body forward like a caterpillar does. Other snakes move by folding and unfolding like an accordion. Many desert snakes use a movement called sidewinding. They throw their body upward and sideways across the sand. Most snakes live alone for most of the year. Some kinds gather for mating or hibernation. Most snakes lay eggs, but others give birth to', 'In the early centuries of the trial jury system, there were often minimum requirements for service as a juror, such as owning land. Women were not allowed to serve. This changed in the twentieth century. Today, it is common for potential jurors to be selected at random from among all adult citizens in the district where the court meets. In the United States jury selection is often based on voter registration rolls. In many jurisdictions people with certain jobs, such as lawyers, members of the clergy, physicians, and police, are exempt from jury duty.', 'A biome is a large region of Earth that has a certain climate and certain types of living things. Major biomes include tundras, forests, grasslands, and deserts. The plants and animals of each biome have traits that help them to survive in their particular biome. Plants and animals that live within smaller areas of a biome also depend on each other for survival. These smaller areas are called ecosystems. Each biome has many ecosystems. The tundra biome is found in extreme northern regions. This biome has cold, dry conditions. The main plants include mosses, lichens, and short grasses. Arctic foxes,', "Nearly all stars are made up mostly of a gas called hydrogen. A star's core is very hot. Great pressure squeezes the core, causing some of the hydrogen to change into a gas called helium. This process produces huge amounts of energy and makes the star shine. Stars vary in size, temperature, brightness, and color. A star's temperature, as well as its chemicals, makes it shine in a certain color. The bluer stars are usually hotter, while the redder stars are cooler. The sun is somewhere in between. It gives off yellow light. The sun is a fairly average star", 'The boa constrictor is a large non poisonous snake. It kills its prey by coiling around it so tightly that the animal cannot breathe. Despite this deadly strength, the boa constrictor has become a popular pet. These snakes normally have mild tempers. They belong to the boa family, along with anacondas, tree boas, and many other types of snake. Boa constrictors can be found in Central and South America. They live in a variety of habitats, including tropical rain forests, grasslands, and drier areas. During the day the boa constrictor rests in tree hollows, old logs, and animal homes called', 'People see an object either because it gives off light or because the object reflects, or bounces back, light. For example, people see the Sun because it gives off its own light. But people see the moon only because it reflects light from the sun. When only the surface of an object can be seen, the object is said to be opaque. Opaque objects do not let light pass through them. Instead they reflect and absorb light. As a result, they are not see through. For example, a mirror is an opaque object that reflects almost all of the light', 'People get coal by mining. In one process, called strip mining, miners take coal from just below the surface. In deep mining, miners dig long tunnels to get to coal that is buried far underground. Mining coal can be dangerous for the miners. Coal miners can be injured or killed when mine roofs collapse. Gases trapped in coal sometimes cause fires or explosions. Many miners have health problems from breathing in coal dust over the years. Compared to other energy resources, coal is inexpensive and plentiful. However, coal has several disadvantages. Burning coal can create acid rain, a dangerous form', 'Every coin collector takes immense pride in showing off their collection. But if not cared for, the collection can lose its value. Spending some time on a regular basis to gather supplies for maintaining your coin collection should be high on your priority list as a collector. Also a good coin collector should be able to easily detect counterfeit coins. Another thing to bear in mind for collectors is that you should never clean the coins unless absolutely needed. A coin fresh from the mint may shine but over the years this shine tends to fade. If necessary clean the', "Ever increasing demands and fast paced schedules are causing everyone's stress levels to escalate. And for every stressor, there seems to be a medication out there to counteract it. Unfortunately, the medications often come with side effects that can adversely affect your health. More and more people are looking for natural methods of relieving stress and anxiety. There's no denying that most adults do not get the proper amount of exercise they need on a daily basis. Vigorous exercise helps to relieve the tension that comes with a stressful lifestyle. This method will also improve your energy level as well", 'Beyond the actual fighting skills themselves students learn avoidance and deescalation techniques so a situation can be avoided before it gets physical, self defense can be purely psychological. Each of the three strands of martial arts has elements of the others included, certainly in terms of the fighting skills and techniques taught. There is considerable debate on the internet concerning the validity of each, however, as long as the particular school is good and has a competent teacher there will be valuable skills on offer. Each of the three strands of martial arts has elements of the others included, certainly', "In a play the characters use their words and movements to tell the story. Often the characters talk to each other. The words of their conversations are known as dialogue. Sometimes, however, a character will make a speech while alone onstage or with the other characters silent. This creates the illusion that the audience can hear the character's thoughts. That kind of speech is called a soliloquy. Occasionally a character will speak directly to the audience. That is called an aside. A playwright might write dialogue that sounds natural, or how people of a particular time and place actually talk.", 'How do people get phobias? They might be scared of spiders. Or maybe flying or clowns. Whatever it is they are afraid of that fear is not a normal one. A phobia is response to what someone thinks is a danger. It does not really make sense. It is normally over the top. It is a response that causes people to avoid their object of fear like the plague. There are three main types. Simple phobias are a fear of something specific. Those fears might be dentists or dogs. This kind tends to form in childhood. It will often go', "A collection of leaves on the ground can sometimes be more artistic than an array of multicolor trees in the distance. Try to look at your location from every possible angle in order to take advantage of less than obvious shots. Also look for opportunities to capture reflections. Many times a scene's beauty can double if it is also seen from a reflective lake, pond or river. Another easy way to improve your Fall photos is to use a tripod. If your shots are taken at a distance or in low light the tripod will help to keep your camera", 'Currents regulate the temperature of the north pacific ocean. Generally, ocean waters are layered, with each layer having a different temperature. The bottom layers of the ocean are considerably colder, near freezing, than the surface layers. Every few years unusually warm currents occur in the south pacific ocean off South America. This rise in temperature is due to a relaxation of the trade winds that move the ocean waters throughout the globe. Without the trade winds, the surface water rate of evaporation declines and heat loss slows. Called El Nino, this periodic increase in temperature fluctuates from a small increase', 'Now that you have an understanding of what is in the splat we can move on to what projected that little paintball to meet your body and marking you.

This article, however, focuses on what the novice player would need or expect and how to go about experiencing the excitement of', "The devices planted on ATMs are usually undetectable by users. The makers of this equipment have become very adept at creating them, often from plastic or plaster, so that they blend right into the ATM's facade. The specific device used for skimming is often a realistic looking card reader placed over the factory installed card reader. Customers insert their ATM card into the phony reader, and their account info is swiped and stored on a small attached laptop or cell phone or sent wirelessly to the criminals waiting nearby. In addition, skimming typically involves the use of a hidden camera,", 'Journalists and reporters have a responsibility to present their stories with facts and evidence to support them. They are not allowed to make up stories, although this sometimes happens. They can, however, give their views, or opinions, about something, if they make it clear that it is opinion, not fact. Sometimes the media may show bias. This means that they choose which types of story to cover and which ones they want to exclude. This bias may be political. Some newspapers support one political party, so they prefer news stories that show their party in a better light than the', 'The blackboard crayon, or chalk, that is used in classrooms is commonly composed of calcium carbonate, kaolin clay, oleic acid, and caustic soda. Dry color may be added to increase the whiteness or to impart specific colors. Modifications of the formulation, such as mixing pigment with a non greasy binder as with pastels, have provided chalk crayons for more specialized use by artists, tailors, and carpenters. For lithographic prints a plain dark colored wax crayon is used to draw an image directly on the stone surface.', 'Until the declaration was signed, America was a part of the British Empire. But as the colonies grew, Americans felt that the British government was treating them unfairly. They felt that they were paying too much in taxes to Britain and thought the colonies should have a say in how things were governed. By June 1776, Americans were tired of trying to work out an agreement with Britain. They were also tired of being told what to do, so they decided to write the Declaration of Independence. On July 8, 1776, the first celebration took place in Philadelphia.', "Before people developed writing, storytelling was the most important way to pass along information. Anything a culture wanted to preserve its beliefs, its history, and its traditions had to be told out loud. Each generation would tell the culture's stories to the next generation. In this way the stories were passed along. Knowledge passed on in this method is called the oral, or spoken, tradition. Even cultures that know how to write still pass along some information in this way. In some cultures everyone would pass along the stories. In other cultures only special storytellers were entrusted with this important", "The floating exchange rate is based on who wants what and how much of it they want; supply and demand. What happens in a supply and demand economy if there's little demand for the supply? That's right, the supply drops and prices can tank. Just think of today's housing market to get a picture of less demand creating a decreasing supply. You'll see fewer new homes being built and few homes being sold. If there's more demand than supply, the prices rise. In the world of currency, this hamster wheel of supply and demand is what helps to keep a", "One of the first things that goes through a new parent's head is the need for safety. Baby proofing your home is a major concern, and rightfully so. Many accidents that happen in the home can be prevented with a few safety precautions. Before you spend a penny on baby proofing accessories, take an inventory throughout your home to look for trouble spots. Some examples of baby dangers are chemicals, open toilets, bathtub faucets, sharp edges on tables and other furniture, staircases, unprotected electrical outlets, heavy furniture such as bookcases and entertainment centers that could fall on baby, window blind", "Frank Bickerton spent most of the 1912 winter working to convert it to a sledge, fashioning brakes from a pair of geological drills and a steering system from the plane's landing gear. It was first tested on the 15th of November, 1912 and subsequently assisted in laying depots for the summer sledging parties, but its use during the expedition was minimal. Towing a train of four sledges, the air tractor accompanied a party led by Bickerton to explore the area to the west of the expedition's base at Cape Denison.

If you ask somebody to say the first word that comes to mind when you mention the word scooter, Razor is most likely to be the one they say. Razor revolutionized the push scooter and gave it more stability and style. They didn't just stick with one version of their widely popular toy; they manufactured them in colors and even created ones that adults can ride. Some Razor scooters have three wheels so once you", 'A small ant might look up at you and think wow, what keeps that large animal from falling over? The secret to your strength lies in your bones.

If you are having too many problems training then it is best to get help from a', 'Combat sports styles obviously have a sport side with the emphasis being on competing. Although people can simply take part in the training if they prefer, schools tend to encourage competition. Through the nature of competition and sport these styles continually develop as rule changes and new methods of competing progress.

Business identity theft has caused many businesses to declare bankruptcy in a last ditch effort to resolve the problem.", "Every animal has to eat and each has a different way of catching its prey. Humans use their hands. Sharks and wolves use their jaws. Frogs are among the few animals that use something much stranger. They use their tongues. To understand just how frogs snatch their snacks, scientists took measurements of the frogs' tongues in action. It was the first time anyone had done that. They found that certain frogs can lift meals up to three times heavier than their body weight. They use a sticking substance similar to the glue on Post-it notes. Scientists did an experiment using", "Although born on land, Polar bears spend much of their time in and around water. They have thick fur and lots of body fat to keep them warm in the harsh Arctic conditions, and have large furry paws that act as snowshoes on land and flippers underwater. To give them better grip on icy surfaces, the pads of a Polar bear's paws are covered in soft little bumps called papillae, which give them better traction like how big treads on snow tires help cars stay on the road in the winter. Their neck and forelimbs are quite long which they", 'Not all rays are bottom feeders. Some, like the manta, are filter feeders. Mantas eat plankton. These are microscopic plants and animals. When a manta comes upon plankton, it swims toward them. As it gets closer, the manta starts to roll. It flips over, end over end, amid the plankton. As it spins, the manta uses flaps on the side of its head to scoop plankton and water toward its mouth. The manta then filters the water through its gills. The water gushes out. The plankton stays in. Rays live in many ocean habitats. They swim from the deep ocean', 'South of the Inyo Craters proper are other features related to the Dike System responsible for creating the craters, volcanoes and lava flows. These include a north south trend of fault scarps up to 20 feet high and pull apart cracks or fissures in the earth. These fissures are not technically faults because little or no vertical or horizontal movement has occurred along them. Most notable among these is earthquake fault, a fissure up to 10 feet wide that cuts 60 to 70 feet into glassy rhyolite lava flows. The fissure was formed by stretching induced by the intrusion of', "At only a few inches long and with no distinctive external features to speak of the hero shrew is seemingly an unremarkable creature. That is, until you accidentally step on one. You see, the Hero Shrew can comfortably survive being stood on by a typical adult human without any injury.

And a new Swiss study now suggests why. Indeed, the study finds, your brain may be conspiring against you. In some people, it may crumple the willpower to eat right. Young men went into the lab for three hours of tests.", 'Some illusions are caused by the way the brain works. A large cardboard box will feel lighter than a small box that is actually the same weight. This happens because the mind expects the bigger box to be heavier because of its size. Because it is not heavier, it feels lighter. The eye can also be deceived by contrasts. If a gray patch of paper is placed on a black background, it looks whiter than it did before; if placed on a white background, it looks darker. Some illusions allow the mind to look at an image in different ways.', 'Leap year happens every four years when an extra day is added to the calendar, making the length of the year 366 days, instead of the normal 365.

But it actually takes earth 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds to complete its orbit, about 365 1\\/4 days. Those extra hours gradually add up so that after four years the calendar is out of step by about one day.

Leaflets, posters, and television advertisements advising parents to have their children vaccinated against illnesses, for example, have a clear aim. In other situations, the message may be communicated in less obvious ways. Television shows often use dramatic storylines and characters to cover social issues. Stories about drug abuse, alcoholism, or serious diseases are just some of the social issues that are addressed by these television programs. They also cover relationship issues, such as bullying, divorce, and parenting.', "You may think insects are gross. Yet people all over the world eat them. The sweetest bugs may be honey ants.

Their abdomens swell like grapes. They use the stored food to feed the ant colony. Ants aren't the only ones that like this honeydew. The Aborigine people in Australia like it, too. They catch the ants. Then they bite off the honey pot and sip the", 'Building materials are chosen based on many factors, including their appearance, strength, availability, and cost. Stone, brick, wood, and concrete have been used for thousands of years. Stone has often been used for large monuments because it lasts a long time and is easy to carve. But it is difficult to cut and transport, and it is too weak for certain support functions. Brick resists fire and is easy to produce, transport, and lay. Wood is very easy to acquire, transport, and work. But it burns easily, can develop mold, and may be eaten by termites. Concrete is made by', 'Ecology is the study of the relationships between living things and their surroundings, or environment. Scientists who work in ecology are called ecologists. Ecologists examine how living things depend on one another for survival. They also study how living things use such natural resources as air, soil, and water to stay alive. Some ecologists work in laboratories. Laboratory experiments allow ecologists to study things under controlled conditions. For instance, they can experiment to see how plants react to different amounts of light or water. Such studies are harder in a natural setting because weather and other natural conditions cannot be', "Chartered air travel has a number of benefits over traveling by regular airline. For starters, a person is not restricted to which day or what time of day that they have to depart. Chartered flights are customized to the customer's needs, which include departure and arrival timings. If the customer is late for a flight, the chartered plane does not merely take off leaving the hapless passenger stuck at the airport. Unlike commercial airlines who rush passengers with veiled threats about closing the boarding gate, a chartered plane will actually wait for their customers to arrive at their leisure.", "This sounds gross, but some scientists think worms may help treat allergies. Researchers have long investigated the link between being too clean and losing immunity to disease. There's some evidence that a little dirt creates an immune response in the body that helps fight off disease and allergies. Some scientists are looking into the possible health benefits of eating worms. These kind of worms are called helminths, and live and grow in a person's intestines. In the Western world, it has been many years since worms were a part of the human biome. This is the term for all organisms", 'Allergies can lead to asthma and dermatitis if left untreated. Be aware of dark circles under the eyes. This is caused by increased blood flow near the sinuses. As we get older, most tend to be susceptible to allergies because our immune systems weaken. Our membranes dry with age and nasal passages weaken. Aging systems fall prey to cumulative effects of allergens constantly attacking the body such as smoke and other air pollutants. Allergy treatments have been known to help asthmatic people. The side effects that allergic asthma have can be minimized by avoiding any allergic substances that spark the', 'The type of paper can vary, and it is important to consider the lighting in your work space.

For this reason, some cities and states are telling riders to stay off of their smartphones and music devices. Cities are trying to make it easier for bicycles to get around. At the same time, more people are using smartphones and music players. Officials are worried that bicycle riders do not pay attention when they are using the devices. They think that riders are putting themselves and other people in danger. Most states do not include bicyclists in cellphone or texting laws. The problem of bicyclists using cellphones and texting is', "Intrinsic motivation is when a person is motivated from within him or herself. They work on a task or project or to achieve a goal simply for the love of doing it. Studies have shown that intrinsic is a better motivator than extrinsic but most of us are spoiled to the point of not doing something unless we're rewarded. Motivation is a behavior you can influence to your advantage. But realize that even a highly motivated person can get discouraged or tired of working on a task if he's not noticed and rewarded. People need to know they're appreciated and", "The humble bee is most famous for its buzz and sting. While both a nuisance and threat, this insect is actually a very important piece of the American food chain. Many have been dying as they cannot find food to eat. These creatures live in areas that are being destroyed by humans through construction, agriculture and pollution. The result is that bee colonies are disappearing fast. Some environmentalists and experts say the decline in bees could become a disaster for our food supply. Bees along with birds, bats and butterflies are important parts of our world's food supply. These creatures", 'Details have been emerging from fossils in rocks that developed at this time. Many organisms suddenly disappeared from the fossil record. Marine arthropods called trilobites, for instance, are common in rocks from the Permian. By the time Triassic age rocks developed, all signs of these critters had vanished. What caused the great dying has long been a mystery. Many scientists suspected that a massive volcanic eruption had something to do with it. Occurring in what is a part of Russia now known as Siberia, this eruption lasted millennia. But there was little hard evidence linking that eruption to the extinctions.', 'Engineers solve problems. They use chemistry, physics, and math to figure out ways to create new things or to improve a product. The goal of engineers is to design things that can solve economic, environmental, or social problems. There are many different kinds of engineering. They often overlap with each other. The largest branches are civil, chemical, electrical, mechanical, and materials engineering. Civil engineering is one of the oldest fields of engineering. It is concerned with the safe design and construction of structures. Chemical engineers deal with large-scale production of chemicals for industrial use. The duties of a chemical engineer', "Why does blowing on a flame make it go out? The answer could be a few different reasons. Your breath has a lot of carbon dioxide. When you blow, the carbon dioxide pushes oxygen out of the way and the flame goes out. Your breath blows away some of the hot air around the flame. If the liquid wax cools down enough, it can't become a gas. Without wax gas, the flame won't burn. Your breath blows some of the wax gas away. Without this fuel, the flame will go out. Why does a flame have different colors? The colors", 'You can purchase a pair of BMX pads and skateboard helmets. Street skating is comparatively less risky, but even then you need to determine the kind of skateboard helmets or other protective gears you need. If you are taking children along with you, make sure that they have put on their skateboard helmets and BMX pads and are always accompanied by adults. There are some commercial skate parks where you can rent the protective gears you need. They offer everything starting from skateboard helmets to BMX pads or any other protective gear that can be needed during skating.', 'Many optical illusions, or illusions that are seen, happen because of the way light behaves. Light travels at different speeds in different substances. It refracts, or bends, as it passes through one substance to another. For example, a ray of light is refracted as it moves from water to air. Therefore a straw standing in water seems broken at the surface where the air and water meet. Mirages and rainbows are also caused by the way light travels. Sounds also travel in ways that affect how they are heard. The siren on an ambulance has a different pitch when it', "The hardest part of the tooth is the outer covering called enamel. It is made mostly of a chemical called calcium phosphate. This is different from the chemical that makes up seashells, which is calcium carbonate. Luckily, sea shells and teeth don't dissolve in water. There is a special soft flexible plastic material that is used to fill a tooth that has a cavity. Once the plastic is in the cavity, the dentist shines a blue light on the plastic which makes it very hard. The special blue light is not ultra violet and is not a laser. It is", "You can't help but tilt your head as you watch Uranus creep closer on your spaceship's view screen. Something about this big ball of bluish green gas just seems off. A closer look at the planet's cloud bands and thirteen faint rings gives you your answer. Uranus is off its rocker! Scientists suspect that a planet size object knocked Uranus sideways in the early days of its formation. It has spun like a top toppling over ever since, which makes for some oddball seasons and decades devoid of even a glint of the sun's faint light. The north pole is", 'Nature is full of thieves. Robber bees raid the hives of other bees and steal their honey. Some ant species kidnap and enslave members of neighboring colonies. Large frigate birds also called pirate birds swoop down on smaller seabirds and snatch the fish right out of their beaks. The sea slugs known as sacoglossans are some of the most remarkable biological burglars on the planet. The animals are about the length of a postage stamp or two. They feed on simple underwater plants known as algae, which have no stems, roots or leaves, but which do contain green colored chlorophyll.', 'A natural fiber can be wide and thick or long and thin. It may feel smooth or rough. Some natural fibers are easy to bend, while others are stiff. Silk and cotton fibers are lightweight and soft. Cloth made from these fibers is perfect for clothes, bed linens, and towels. On the other hand, wool can feel rough and itchy. Since wool is very warm, however, it is often used to make sweaters and blankets. People use natural fibers that are bumpy, rough, and scaly to make heavier objects. For example, straw, jute, and hemp can be woven into mats,', 'The principle that makes a kite fly is the same as that which keeps an airplane aloft. An airplane creates its own wind by its speed through the air. On a calm day running with a kite in an open space produces the same effect. The kite rises because currents of air, moving parallel to the ground, strike the face of the kite and force it backward. The best wind for kite flying is a steady breeze with a speed of about eight to twenty miles per hour. Less wind makes it difficult to get the kite up. Stronger winds', 'Looking to increase productivity and reduce stress in your employees? You might want to use some aromatherapy oils in the office. Neroli and nutmeg are two scents that help reduce stress and increase productivity. Chamomile, lavender and petitgrain are scents that can be used to help treat insomnia.

Keep track of how different scents affect your mood and mindset and then use them around the house or in the office as needed. You can even find aromatherapy products for the car if you', 'Using a camera to take photographs is called photography. A photograph is an image, or picture, that has been captured on film or some other material. People who take pictures are called photographers. Photography is a useful form of communication. Photographs give information about people, places, objects, and events that words may not be able to describe. Newspapers and magazines have printed photographs of interesting people and events for over 200 years. Advertisers and other businesses use photography to show people their products. Scientists, doctors, and police officers use photography to record important information.', 'Over time, geckos have adapted to survive in the warm, wet rainforest. They developed special toes that let them cling to wet leaves and scurry up slippery vines. They developed legs that let them run quickly and great eyesight so that they can see colors in the dark. Some grew special skin flaps that let them glide through the air. Geckos also became the only lizards with voices, which they use to communicate. Some geckos adapted in ways that changed their looks. The leaf-tailed gecko has folds of skin that help disguise its body. Its tail even looks like a', 'Imagine a new chocolate that keeps you younger looking. It seems too good to be true, but a team of scientists believes they have invented anti ageing chocolate. A laboratory working with Cambridge University has been working on a method to keep away wrinkles and keep the skin looking younger. It has called its new product Esthechoc. This is a combination of the words esthetic and chocolate. The new product is also called Cambridge Beauty Chocolate. The laboratory used a special chemical called an antioxidant in the chocolate. The antioxidant they used is one that gives flamingos their pink color.', "Male and female brains may be built differently, but they think alike. Scientists say that human brains cannot be categorized as typically male or female, although there are differences. Researchers looked at results from more than one hundred studies. They found differences in areas of the brain that control language, memory, emotion and behavior. The report appeared in a scientific magazine. Scientists noted that male brains are built differently than female brains, and the volume of a man's brain is about eight to thirteen percent greater than that of a woman. The scientists then wanted to find out if those", "Africa is home to most of the world's rhinos. However, the country has a big problem with poachers. Hunters killed more than twelve thousand of the country's rhinos last year and are killing them at a high rate this year to meet rising demand for their horns in parts of Asia. The buyers believe rhino horn, which is ground into powder, works as medicine. There is no scientific evidence to back up that idea. The horn is made of keratin, a protein also found in human fingernails. South Africa's national parks service rescued sixteen rhino orphans last year. A dozen", 'These guns work the same as normal laser tag guns. It was referred to as the MILES system, and allowed intense training abilities in the army. Some combat training is still used today. A man by the name of Carter invented the first arena type laser game. He surprisingly thought of the idea after watching the film Star Wars. In 1986, laser tag was revealed as an at home game. Laser tag toys were being purchased more than any other game or toy at the time. The toys are continued to be made, and beloved by children around the world.', 'Mimicry is when one living thing resembles a different kind of living thing. Mimicry helps animals and plants in various ways. It can keep them from being eaten or it can help them get food. Mimicry helps protect some types of butterfly in Brazil from birds. These butterflies taste good to birds. However, they have markings similar to those of bad tasting butterflies. Birds see these markings and stay away. Sometimes different types of dangerous or bad-tasting living things look like each other. Sand wasps and yellow jackets are different types of insect. But they look similar, and they both', "By experimenting with the number of rocks, you'll be able to regulate the heat. The other method is for warming your sleeping area. Remove the bedding materials and dig a trench one foot wide by one foot deep and about body length. Place the hot rocks in the trench and cover the rocks with six inches of dirt. After the moisture has baked from the ground, replace the bedding and get ready to spend a warm night.

The bighorn sheep canyon got its name from', 'Among the tall towers and tourists crowding the popular streets of Chicago are members of an often overlooked population homeless men and women with signs begging for change. Many of these signs seem like they were hastily scribbled. But over the past few months, many of them have been replaced by an art student who hoped that beautiful lettering would allow the signs to stand out in the busy streets of Chicago. The students hope was that the Chicago project would create some awareness around the homeless and also that people would be more inclined to talk when they walk', "Carbon dioxide is a chemical compound that is usually in the form of a gas. It is made up of one atom of carbon and two atoms of oxygen. Carbon dioxide was discovered by a Belgian chemist named Jan Baptista van Helmont. Carbon dioxide is necessary for life on Earth. When animals breathe out, they release carbon dioxide into the air. Plants use this carbon dioxide to make their own food in a process called photosynthesis. Plants then release oxygen into the air for animals to breathe in. Carbon dioxide also is an essential part of Earth's atmosphere. It plays", "Sculpture is a branch of the visual arts. It involves the creation of artistic objects in three dimensions length, width, and height. The main feature of a sculpture's design is the way its forms extend through space. Size, texture, light and shade, and color are also important design elements. A sculpture may look exactly like a person or object or may reflect shapes and forms that the artist invents. Sculpture may be either in the round or in relief. A sculpture in the round stands on its own. It can be viewed from all sides. A relief is attached to", "Rain is a part of Earth's endless water cycle. At the beginning of the cycle, sunlight heats up water on Earth's surface. The heat causes the water to evaporate, or to turn into water vapor. This water vapor rises into the air. As the water vapor cools, it turns back into water, in the form of droplets. The droplets form around dust and other particles through a process called condensation. Clouds form from large numbers of these droplets. In a cloud, droplets come together with other droplets to form larger drops of water. Eventually, the drops become too heavy to", 'Geraniums are flowering plants that grow in the wild as well as in gardens. There are many different types of geraniums. Most have strong fragrances, or smells. Geraniums are common in mild, somewhat moist climates. Garden plants grow well in soil that is not watered too much.

Probiotics added to yogurts aid in digestion. Natural colors added to whole grain", 'In the last twenty years, astronomers have identified about two thousand new worlds using a telescope in space. These planets orbit stars that lie tens or even hundreds of light years from Earth. These discoveries are important, but no single planet is likely to be much of a big deal. The new planet is a very different story. It does not circle a distant star. Instead, it is part of our own solar system, a place you would think we had explored pretty well by now. Evidently not. In a new study shows scientists found strong evidence of a very', "A gecko's tail allows it to balance when falling from a tree or climbing a slippery wall and helps it escape from hungry predators. If a gecko loses its grip and falls, the tail can help it land safely. The gecko twists, rotating its body and feet downward into a landing position. Then the gecko spreads its legs and glides, using its tail to steer. If a predator tries to take a bite out of a gecko's tail, the gecko simply releases its tail. The predator may have a mouthful of tail, but the gecko is safe. Losing its tail", 'The serve is the most important stroke in tennis. A good player can serve the ball to any spot on the service court. A ball can also be made to bounce in different ways when it hits the ground. This is done by turning the racket in the hand and putting spin on the ball when it is struck by the racket. A perfect serve is called an ace. This happens when a serve is so well placed or is hit so hard that it is impossible for the receiver to return the ball. A let is a serve that', "We all procrastinate to some degree. There are always other things you could be doing. Some say there's no cure for procrastination so perhaps we need to seek not to prevent it but to slow it in the best way possible. Procrastinators are late for appointments and have difficulty estimating the amount of time it takes to arrive at a destination or completing a task. They even resort to tricking their mind by setting their clock or watch a few minutes ahead. If you think you're a chronic procrastinator admit to your problem and make a decision to overcome it.", "In the past, engineers have developed other ways to cram more data into each beam of light traveling through some fiber in a cable. They've also found ways to send multiple streams, for instance by using light beams of different colors. But in the near future, even those fixes won't keep up with the growing data demands of users. A physicist at Boston University, helped design a new cable. He and his coworkers developed a way to keep multiple beams of light from mixing in a single fiber. They built a 1.1 kilometer fiber treated with chemicals that change the", 'The region has been used by humans for centuries. Obsidian was collected by Mono Paiutes for making sharp tools and arrow points. Glassy rock continues to be removed in modern times for use as commercial scour and yard decoration.

But it's clear that the moon sized space station wasn't the most well thought out venture. After all, what good is a planet destroying weapon if it can be taken down by one measly little X-Wing? As it turns out, the Empire totally overlooked another design. It would have been faster, cheaper and more effective. It could have simply built the Death Star around an asteroid. The biggest problem with the Death Star aside from that pesky exhaust port blasted apart is that building", 'However, there were legal problems and these delayed the permission that was needed to build the subway and tram route. Permission to build the subway was not given until 1906, and they were still not allowed to build the tram line over the bridge. The tunnel would also only be able to have single deck trams in it. This was because of a sewer at the northern end of the tunnel and the district railway at the southern end. When the trams left the subway at the southern end they could turn right along the Embankment to Westminster bridge or', "This condition shows up physically after you're awake by making you feel sluggish. As you go about your daily tasks, you feel like you have weights attached to your muscles. In some cases, your muscles will start to ache from not getting enough rest. You may notice a general feeling that something's off with your body. You'll have a feeling of fatigue that doesn't go away, no matter how many times you sit during the day and try to relax. Feeling drowsy throughout the day can be a symptom and so can inability to stay awake. If you begin napping", 'The western bumble bee lives in a variety of habitats including flowering grasslands, savannas and alpine meadows. These areas provide ideal feeding ground for the adults, but Western bumble bees may also be seen in agricultural fields and searching for wildflowers on forest floors. Bumble bees are considered generalist flower visitors in that they visit and pollinate flowers from a wide variety of plant species, including food crops such as tomatoes, blueberries, cranberries and cherries, among many others.', "Bake from scratch. You pay more for ready mixes of cakes and cookies. Prepared foods will cost you more so do a little more work and save. Even the fancy cut pastas, rather than the plain, will add to your grocery bill. Look for the mark down areas. You might find fresh meat or vegetables that are about to go out of date but if you're cooking them soon that's no problem. Check the receipt for errors. Plan a shopping day and avoid unnecessary trips. Keep your recipes simple and shop happy. Angry shoppers tend to impulse buy. Shop early", "Your dashboard is your friend and usually if your vehicle is having a problem a warning light will come on to alert you. If you notice that your check engine light comes on, take your vehicle in for an inspection as soon as possible. Although the check engine light can be indicative of many things, even something as simple as an electronic sensor or computer chip malfunction, it can also indicate a possible transmission problem, so it is always better to be safe than sorry here. Don't always think the worst case scenario just because you see warning lights come", 'Folktales are a kind of story that gets passed on from generation to generation. True folktales do not have a single author. They develop as different people tell them over time. As such, they are creations of the folk, or the people. Many folktales are very old. For generations the tales were spoken aloud and never written down. Storytellers would memorize the stories and keep them alive. Modern authors may write their own versions of popular kinds of traditional tales, such as fables and fairy tales. Also, folktales that began as ancient spoken stories may now be written down in', 'The average speed of Viking ships varied from ship to ship but lay in the range of 5 to 10 knots and the maximum speed of a longship under favorable conditions was around 15 knots. Longships were the epitome of Scandinavian naval power at the time, and were highly valued possessions. They were often owned by coastal farmers and commissioned by the King in times of conflict, in order to build a powerful naval force. While longships were used by the Norse in warfare, they were troop transports, not warships. In the tenth century, these boats would sometimes be tied', 'Some two hundred million years ago life on Earth nearly ended. In a geologic flash, at least seventy percent of our land species vanished along with ninety six percent of all species in the oceans. This was a mass extinction. The biggest ever, it far exceeded the one that snuffed out the dinosaurs some one hundred and eighty million years later. That one knocked out only fifty percent of the species. The earlier catastrophe is now known as the permo triassic mass extinction because it occurred as the permian period gave way to the triassic. Its impacts were so massive', "He's certainly not the only one to embrace this valuable way of thinking as more surgeons look to therapies such as Reiki to help their patients heal. Reiki, an asian energy therapy, is said to help put the body back into balance after a serious illness or surgery. This tradition requires a therapist who is trained on how to touch 12 to 15 points on the body to help relieve pain and stress associated with an illness or surgery. Chinese research has recently said that combining western and eastern medical techniques was a good thing for both the patient and", 'Chocolate begins with the seeds of the cacao tree. The cacao tree grows in warm areas of North and South America, Africa, and Asia. The seeds form in long, cucumber shaped fruits called pods. When the pods are ripe, workers cut them from the tree and remove the seeds. The seeds sit for several days before being dried, either by the sun or in an oven. The dry seeds, called cocoa beans, are then shipped to processing plants or chocolate factories. At the plant or factory, workers roast the beans in giant ovens to bring out their flavor. Machines then', "If you've already begun working with your child on recognizing her alphabet, then you can make this method even more effective by asking her if she can recognize any of the letters on the page. As she points to the letters she knows, make a point to sound them out, and repeat them along with their companions in whatever word is in question. There are many flashcards you can purchase to help your child when it comes to word and picture recognition. Think about everything you've seen regarding A is for apple. In addition to the memorization a child must", "The earth has been around for a very long time. In those millions of years, it has undergone many changes. Scientists can learn about the history of the planet by examining clues in rock and soil. Like the rings on a tree trunk, the layers of the earth tell the planet's story. Scientists divide this story into different chapters, based on the changes the planet has gone through. First, scientists have split earth's history into a few big sections, called eons. Each is made up of a few eras. Eras are made up of periods, and periods are made up", "Reflexology is the study of how reflex points on the hands and feet can help reduce stress on other areas of the body that might be causing pain, sleeplessness and other problems. Reflexology stimulates the body so that it takes care of its own healing process. In reflexology treatments, pressure is applied by the thumb and other finger pressure to certain reflex areas on the patient's hands and feet. According to reflexologists, this stimulation causes misplaced energy to rebalance itself and help the associated body parts to heal. Both of the feet, when placed together are said to form a", 'Prehistoric traders of the Delaware tribes made camp on the bank of what would someday be called the Allegheny River. Hundreds of years later settlers cut forests and built settlements near where three large rivers meet. A century after, more immigrants arrived, invented a middle class and rose to power in the city. Archaeological evidence of each group is still there, buried under centuries of city development. Archaeologists said it is now easier to link items with the people who owned them long ago due to modern research methods.', 'Past experiments have shown that children as young as four years old think it is unfair to have less than others. However, children do not think it is unfair to have more than others until they are eight years old. That difference shows that children may have to learn that it is unfair to have more than others. The scientists wanted to find out which feelings about fairness might be shared by all children and which might be learned only in certain countries. To do this, the scientists built an inequity game for children to play. This game was played', 'Throughout the history of time music of some kind has been used or expressed. The actual term music means sounds that produce effect through voice or instrument. In its purest form music is a universal language that people of any culture can relate to. This is evident when you analyze the situation from a global and cultural view. Music, that is the combination of rhythm, beat, and song is used to provoke and inflame emotions. This is how a song or even a rhythmic poem can cause you to cry and just as quickly, make you angry and ready for', 'Most caves are called solution caves. Solution caves most often form in places where there is a type of rock called limestone. Limestone is a soft rock that dissolves, or breaks down, easily in water. As water flows through small cracks in the limestone, the limestone dissolves and the cracks get bigger. Over a long time these cracks become large enough for people to enter. Not all caves form in limestone. They can form in such rock as gypsum, marble, and dolomite. Caves may also form when melted rock, called lava, flows from volcanoes. The lava on the surface may', "It has been observed that geckos have the ability to climb walls, hang upside down, and stick to anything. Aristotle was the first known to have commented stating geckos have the ability to run up and down a tree in any way, even with the head downwards. It wasn't until recently that it was discovered what gave them this spider man like ability. Geckos have millions of tiny hairs on their toes called setae. All combined, these hair like tissues give a washboard type appearance to a geckos toes. Each one of these seta have thousands of thinner hair like", "China has ended its decades long one child policy. Now all couples will be allowed to have two children. The one child policy started in the late nineteen seventies. It was to control the population and avoid high rates of poverty. It wasn't kept too strictly and there were many exceptions. Around a third of the population could have just one child. Just over half was allowed to have a second child if the first child was a girl. The new two child policy should increase fertility rates. The new two child policy should boost China's economy and stop China", "Natural resins are thick liquid substances that come from trees. Scientists have learned how to make artificial resins that act like the natural forms. Both are used to make many different products. They are yellowish to brown in color and are fairly clear. Many come from pine or fir trees. They drip through an opening in the tree's bark where the bark has been injured by wind, fire, lightning, or other causes. When resins dry out they become very hard. Fossil resin, or amber, is resin that hardened over millions of years after it fell to the ground and became", 'There are hundreds of different types of cell in the human body. Most of them start out as stem cells. Stem cells contain the instructions needed to make the cell grow into a specialized type, such as a muscle, nerve, or blood cell. The ways that stem cells develop into specialized cells is not yet fully understood. Scientists are working on the idea that a stem cell can be instructed to grow into a particular type of cell, such as a liver cell. If enough liver cells are grown to produce liver tissue that works normally, they could be transplanted', "The iceberg has slashed holes in the side of one of the furnace rooms. As water gushes through the holes, it nearly sweeps the crewmen off their feet. Within minutes, the cold, swirling seawater is up to their waists. Seawater is also gushing through holes torn into other sections of the ship. Titanic's hull has 16 sections. Doors can seal off each section if they are damaged.

They may also enjoy the fact that they're taking care of the environment by not using harmful chemicals. Vegetable gardening is great for people who have a relatively decent amount of time to care for their garden, and who are physically able to do so. Vegetable gardening can be back breaking work, so it's important to be sure you can physically handle this type of work. It may not be very good for people who aren't", "Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences in the world. The study of astronomy involves all of the objects outside Earth's atmosphere. These include the sun, moon, planets, stars, galaxies, and all other matter in the universe. People known as astronomers have studied these objects for thousands of years. Most of the universe's objects are located in galaxies. The galaxies are huge groups of stars along with gas and dust. Some galaxies contain as many as a trillion stars. The smaller galaxies may have fewer than a million stars. The planet Earth is located in a galaxy. One of the", 'According to the Chinese, the forces in the universe are believed to affect everything in life, including our health. These forces are represented by the symbol of yin and yang, the two most powerful cosmic forces in the universe. Yin is the female force and is represented by the moon, while yang represents the masculine force and is represented by the sun. From these ancient beliefs, the Chinese developed a technology for health care that in many ways rivals that of western medicine. These alternatives methods were initially thought to be quackery, but as scientific evidence surfaced to prove otherwise,', 'If you are interested in a high value alternative to buying a brand new car, a used car can be the best option for you. The technological advancements have made it very easy for you to search for a used car suiting your budget and requirement. The main reason for why used cars are better is affordability. Buying a brand new car is more expensive than buying a used one. The tax procurement and registration fees required for used cars are less than those procured on the brand new cars. Moreover, the initial costs on a new car are hefty.', 'There are both indoor, and outdoor equipment for laser tag. When played indoor at an arena, the laser is visible through the use of fog. A series of vests, and guns are assigned to all of the players in order to experience the entirety of the game play. In order for an indoor arena to properly work, one must understand the necessary materials. A large area is required with many things to hide behind. A smoke machine, and black lights are also necessary. Scoring devices are also required to be in the arena. On the other hand, an outdoor arena', 'You might be one of those people that perform very well when it comes to sports. If you are and you are in high school, you might have the idea that your ability at a given sport could end up putting you in line for a sports scholarship that will either entirely pay for college, or at least partially pay for your higher education. However, there is more to getting a scholarship than just being good at sports. One thing you have to understand is that with sports scholarships there are a few ways to get them. For some, especially', "These muscles are called smooth muscles because they appear smoother than other muscles. Smooth muscles can be found throughout your body, including in your stomach, in your blood vessels, in your digestive system, and in your eyes. They are used to move food through your digestive system, regulate blood flow, and decrease the size of your pupils when there is too much light. Smooth muscle cells are smaller than skeletal muscle cells and only have one nuclei. Also, unlike skeletal muscle cells, smooth muscle cells don't have striations, or stripes.", 'Some of the folklore animals are a combination of man and beast, such as the centaur and the minotaur. The centaur is part horse and part man, while the minotaur is half man and half bull. More familiar to modern readers are mermaids, which are half fish and half woman. With their counterparts, mermen, they were considered in folklore to be natural beings who had magical powers. Though sometimes kindly, they were normally considered dangerous to people. To see one was believed to be an omen of a coming sea wreck. They sometimes lured mortals to death by drowning, and', "The snow leopard is a moderately large cat native to the mountain ranges of central Asia. Snow leopards show several adaptations for living in a cold mountainous environment. Their bodies are stocky, their fur is thick, and their ears are small and rounded, all of which help to minimize heat loss. Their paws are wide, which distributes their weight better for walking on snow, and have fur on their undersides to increase their grip on steep and unstable surfaces. Snow leopards' tails are long and flexible, helping them to maintain their balance in the rocky terrain they inhabit. Their tails", 'Latitude is the angular distance of any object from the equator measured in degrees. The angular distance from the equator to itself is 0, thus the latitude at the equator is 0 degrees. If we move either up or down from the equator, our distance increases, and so does our angle to it. Eventually we reach either the North or South Pole. Standing on these poles, places us at exactly a 90 degree angle to the equator. At any location on earth we can draw a circle around it, representing every point that is at the same latitude.', 'Humans are the only extant catarrhines that have spread successfully outside of Africa, South Asia, and East Asia, although fossil evidence shows many other species were formerly present in Europe. Considered generalist mammals, primates exhibit a wide range of characteristics. Some primates including some great apes and baboons are primarily terrestrial rather than arboreal, but all species possess adaptations for climbing trees. Locomotion techniques used include leaping from tree to tree, walking on two or four limbs, knuckle walking, and swinging between branches of trees known as brachiation.', "Can you imagine how much money you'd save, not to mention your sanity, if you could locate those golf balls that are sent spinning into out of bounds areas whenever you hit the links? Golf ball locators are now routinely used on the course by newcomers and veteran golfers who don't want to spend hundreds of dollars a month replacing balls that were sent spiraling off into no man's land. Sometimes a golf ball can be right in front of your nose and you just can't see it. It might be hiding under a leaf or blocked by your view", 'All board games have a board and playing pieces, though they may use dice and other accessories as well. Board games differ from tile games, such as dominoes. Cribbage and other games that involve playing cards are not considered board games, even though a board may be used to keep score. The oldest board games are known to be backgammon, checkers, and chess. People probably first played these games on the ground, using stones, bones, or shells as pieces. The earliest versions of these games were most likely to imitate the everyday activities of the players, many of whom were', "A belief in fairies has long been an important part of Irish folklore. Fairies are believed to have both good and bad effects on people's lives. Although not many people claim to have seen them, their presence is often recorded in folklore. Because of their magical powers, it is considered very foolish to risk annoying them. Places where they might live or gather are treated with care and a certain amount of fear. In earlier times, farmers did not like to interfere with ring forts, round areas banked by earth and often in the middle of a field, because they", 'Among these important changes were the introduction of the line of scrimmage and of down and distance rules. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, game play developments by college coaches such as Eddie Cochems, Amos Alonzo Stagg, Knute Rockne, and Glenn Warner helped take advantage of the newly introduced forward pass. The popularity of collegiate football grew as it became the dominant version of the sport for the first half of the twentieth century. Bowl games, a college football tradition, attracted a national audience for collegiate teams. Bolstered by fierce rivalries, college football still holds widespread appeal in', "Scientists connect contagious yawning to empathy. When a person is empathic, they can sense other people's feelings. They may even feel the way the other person does. Contagious yawning seems to start when children are four or five years old, about the same time children start to develop empathy. In old age it falls off, along with empathy. Scientists looked at why contagious yawning is related to empathy. They say it uses the same neural network. A neural network is a system of cells that send messages to the brain, spine and nerves. Contagious yawning also happens more with friends", "The oceans are changing. You can't tell by standing on a beach and watching waves roll in.

It's an obligation you assume for many years and a small difference in any part of the negotiations can make a big difference in your monthly payments. Mortgage lenders want your business so don't be afraid to negotiate. Do your homework and let them know you're shopping around for the best deal. The more you know, the better position you're in to bargain. It's your money and worth the effort. Rarely are rates and terms engraved in stone in the negotiating stage.", "Oysters make pearls to defend against foreign objects. The process begins when some foreign body, such as sand, a parasite or some other organic material, manages to make its way inside the oyster's shell and comes in contact with the mantle, a layer that protects the oyster's internal organs, sometimes even damaging it. The oyster's body sees the invading substance as a potential threat, and in response the mantle begins to deposit a substance called nacre, also called mother of pearl, onto it. This is the same substance that coats the inner part of the shell. External damage to the", 'Formula one cars are considered to be the fastest circuit racing cars in the world, owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce. Formula one cars race at speeds of up to 360 kph with engines limited in performance to a maximum of 18,000 revolutions per minute. The cars are capable of lateral acceleration in excess of 5 g in corners. The performance of the cars is very dependent on electronics, although traction control and other driving aids have been banned since 2008, and on aerodynamics, suspension and tires.', 'Gold plating is when real gold is adhered to another metal. Gold plating jewelry is a complex process. You should only allow a professional who knows exactly what they are doing to gold plate your jewelry. If they tell you they are going to apply the gold plating directly to the silver, run, do not walk out of there. Gold and silver react with each other.

They may tell you that they will add a layer of copper over the silver then apply', "The brains of vertebrates other than humans are divided into three main sections, hindbrain, midbrain, and forebrain. In fish and amphibians, the midbrain is the main center of the brain. The midbrain is less important in mammals, birds, and reptiles. However, these animals have larger forebrains. The cerebrum is the largest part of the forebrain in mammals, birds, and reptiles. It is the center of learning in those animals. The brains of insects, lobsters, squid, and other invertebrates are groups of nerve cells. These groups are located at the ends of nerve cords that run through the animal's body.

Two minutes after liftoff, the boosters fell back to Earth, where they could be recovered. The fuel in the tank was used up just before the shuttle went into orbit around Earth. The orbiter released the tank, and it broke up in Earth's atmosphere. Shuttles could remain in space for up to about two weeks. Astronauts onboard carried out scientific experiments. They released satellites that the shuttle had brought from Earth. They also repaired broken satellites. The orbiter sometimes linked up with other spacecraft as well.

Because globes are the same shape as the earth, it is possible to create very accurate globes. We do not have', 'Coal has several different forms. Anthracite is hard coal. It produces the greatest amount of heat and is used mainly for heating homes. Bituminous coal is soft. Power plants use it to produce electricity. Bituminous coal is also used in steel mills to make coke, another kind of fuel. Lignite, the softest coal, is used to produce gas and electricity. People get coal by mining. In one process, called strip mining, miners take coal from just below the surface. In deep mining, miners dig long tunnels to get to coal that is buried far underground. Mining coal can be dangerous', 'The closest analogs within the milky way galaxy of the stars producing long gamma ray bursts are likely the Wolf Rayet stars, extremely hot and massive stars which have shed most or all of their hydrogen due to radiation pressure. Eta Carinae and WR 104 have been cited as possible future gamma ray burst progenitors. It is unclear if any star in the Milky Way has the appropriate characteristics to produce a gamma ray burst. The massive star model probably does not explain all types of gamma ray burst. There is strong evidence that some short duration gamma ray bursts', 'The amalaki fruit is also used as an anti inflammatory when the extract is removed from the leaves of the same tree. It provides an anti fungal and anti microbial attribute when used topically. Cancer studies in mice have shown that the amalaki fruit reduces the effects that cancer cells have on ravishing the body and when used prior to radiation, offers a protective shield to damaging the chromosomes. During medical studies conducted on rabbits, amalaki had a cholesterol reducing effect on rabbits whose numbers were elevated over a 60 day timeframe.', 'Grasses have stems with joints. A leaf sprouts from each joint. Except for corn, sorghum, and a few others, grasses have hollow stems. The stems of many grasses grow close to the ground, so mainly the leaves are visible. In tropical regions grass leaves are broad. Desert grasses have spiky leaves that help keep moisture inside. The leaves of some water grasses are waxy. The waxiness protects them from the water. Grasses depend on the wind to scatter their pollen and seeds. Some grass seeds will sprout quickly if they land in the soil. Others need to freeze before sprouting.', 'Researchers looked at brain scans of more than fourteen thousand men and women but could not find any patterns that make men and women different. The team looked at a variety of scans, different parts of the brain, and different groups of people. Researchers found that there are male and female differences in brain structure.

This helps new grasses grow and keeps the pastures healthy. Eating sea grass and algae has turned her body fat a green color. In fact, this is how green sea turtles get their name. When the turtle is about 26 years old, she must return to the beach where she was born to lay her eggs. She begins her long trek back to Tortuguero. She may have to travel over 621 miles to get there. Using her senses and strong flippers, she finds her way to Tortuguero.', "Most navies keep a fleet, or group, of ships that are specially built for certain types of work. Aircraft carriers are ships that carry aircraft. Aircraft can land and take off from their decks. Cruisers and destroyers are ships that fight with guns or rocket-propelled missiles. Submarines and destroyers fight with underwater weapons, such as mines and torpedoes. More than one hundred countries have a navy. The United States has the world's largest and most powerful navy.", 'Many people think the vulture is an ugly bird. Across the world, it is often seen as a symbol for death. In Africa, however, vultures are the ones having a tough time. People are killing them. They also crash into electricity towers and wind turbines and die. Their numbers are falling fast. Animals that could die out forever are put on a list kept by a nature group. Africa has eleven types, or species, of vultures. Four of those species were on the list this year. One study found that seven vulture species fell in number by at least four', 'The first year is a big one for babies: Everything is new. Infants pick up a lot of information that will be useful throughout their lives. What happens then and on into the preschool years sets the stage for behavior in the years to come. A new study now finds that young children who started life in rough, stressful situations showed signs of anxiety as teens. Their brains also behaved differently from those of teens who felt more secure during their early childhood. Your brain has ways to deal with anxiety, but that coping ability may not work as well', "Finding our roots is becoming more than just a passing hobby, it's an obsession for many who want to discover just how far back they can go to find their ancestors and place them on the family tree. Traditionally, these roots were mapped out on paper, pen in hand; a tedious task that made more people loathe the process than embrace it. But now, with the onset of digital evolution, men and women alike are mapping their family trees using software and online websites devoted to genealogy buffs. Discovering who should go onto your family tree is only part of", 'A tablet is a small, flat computer that is operated by touching the screen. It is smaller than a regular laptop and larger than a cell phone. Tablets allow users to access the Internet, read and send email, watch videos, listen to music, and read electronic books, or e books. They also run computer programs called applications, or apps. Apps let people play games, shop, read, get maps and directions, set appointments, and do many other tasks. The tablet concept has been around for many years. The first tablets had a keyboard or a stylus that allowed users to input', 'A macaque monkey who took now famous selfie photographs cannot be declared the copyright owner of the photos, a federal judge has ruled, saying while congress and the president can extend the protection of law to animals as well as humans, there is no indication that they did so in the copyright act. The lawsuit was filed last year by people for the ethical treatment of animals and it sought a court order allowing them to represent the monkey. They wanted the court to let it administer all proceeds from the photos for the benefit of the monkey, which was', 'The Iditarod Trail sled dog race is an annual long distance race run in early March from Anchorage to Nome. The race is a reconstruction of the historic freight route used by natives and commemorates the part that sled dogs played in the settlement of Alaska. Mushers and a team of 12 to 16 dogs cover the distance in 9 to 15 days. The trail is composed of two routes; a northern trail traveled on even numbered years and a southern trail traveled on odd numbered years. The original sled dogs were Inuit sled dogs chosen for strength and stamina.', 'If a hurricane is likely in your area, you should listen to the radio or TV for information. Turn off utilities if instructed to do so. Turn off propane tanks. Stay indoors during a hurricane and away from windows and glass doors. Close all interior doors secure and brace external doors. Keep curtains and blinds closed. Do not be fooled if there is a lull; it could be the eye of the storm and winds will pick up again. Take refuge in a small interior room, closet, or hallway on the lowest level. Lie on the floor under a table', 'In 1911, Carrier disclosed his basic rational psychrometric formulae to the American society of mechanical engineers. The formula still stands today as the basis in all fundamental calculations for the air conditioning industry. Carrier said he received his flash of genius while waiting for a train. It was a foggy night and he was going over in his mind the problem of temperature and humidity control. By the time the train arrived, Carrier had an understanding of the relationship between temperature, humidity and dew point.', 'The ground is shaking at an elementary school in Yelm. Students and geologists huddle around a computer, watching jagged lines scroll across the screen and measuring a mini earthquake. The students are not really experiencing an earthquake. Their classmates caused it by leaping into the air together and landing with a thud that vibrated the ground. Geologists explain that he and his crew are measuring the way seismic waves move through the soil. They want to estimate how hard the ground will shake in future earthquakes. The work is part of a test project that involves several Washington public schools.', 'As marine mammals, beluga whales need to take in air from the surface using a special structure on their backs called a blowhole. Just before surfacing, the beluga opens its blowhole and exhales, producing a spray of seawater. Once its back is above the surface, the beluga quickly takes a deep breath of fresh oxygenated air before using muscles to close the blowhole and slip back under water. Beluga whales are able to hold their breath under water for up to fifteen minutes.', 'There are several different types of forest biome. The taiga is a conifer forest biome. It lies just south of the tundra biome. The taiga has long, cold winters and short, mild summers. It gets more rain than tundras do, so it can support conifers. Conifers are trees with needles, such as spruces and firs. Lynx, timber wolves, moose, and beavers live in this biome. Deciduous forests are found mainly in the Northern Hemisphere. This biome has cold winters and warm summers. The trees are deciduous, meaning that they shed their leaves in the fall. Deer, bears, bobcats, and squirrels', "This can be hard enough when you're just rising for work, school, or college but to get up earlier than you need to seems ridiculous to some. The first thing you need to do is actually set your alarm early enough to leave time to get yourself ready, remember you need to be back in time to cool down and get ready for your day ahead. A trick some use is to position an alarm clock out of arms reach so one has to get out of bed to turn it off. Needless to say the snooze button is not", 'All the machines of modern life require energy to make them run. About ninety percent of that energy comes from burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuels include petroleum, coal, and natural gas. These materials are called fossil fuels because, like fossils, they are the remains of organisms that lived long ago. Organisms are plants, animals, and other living things. Fossil fuels formed in the Earth hundreds of millions of years ago. Dead organisms sank into mud and rock. Over time many layers of rock built up. The remains of the organisms slowly changed in form to become different kinds of fossil', 'At the scene of a crime, detectives look for evidence, or clues to help them figure out who committed the crime. Evidence includes fingerprints, footprints, bits of cloth, blood, hair, and anything else that the criminal may have left behind. When they find the person who they think committed the crime, they arrest that person. The person may then be put on trial to determine if they did commit the crime. During the trial, the detectives and other police officers often talk about the evidence they gathered when they were investigating the crime.', 'Captain E J Smith knows Titanic is doomed. He orders some of his crew to prepare the lifeboats. Since the ship has only 20 lifeboats, he knows not everyone will be able to escape. Smith wants to save as many passengers as possible. He sends other crew members around the ship to wake the passengers. Everyone is told to put on a life jacket. Smith also sends out distress calls to other ships. Only one ship is close enough to help. She is coming, but she is three hours away. The waiting passengers shiver in the cold. Some are wearing', "Light flows from the sun and travels through space. It takes a little more than eight minutes for the sun's light to reach earth. That means the sunlight you are seeing right now left the sun eight minutes ago. Bright arches of hot glowing gas erupt from the surface of the sun. With the unaided eye, the sun looks quiet and calm. You can see something completely different through a telescope. It is dynamic. Gases boil and pop. Fiery storms rage across its super-hot surface. One kind of storm, called sunspots, looks like dark blotches. A sunspot looks dark because", "The faster you drive, the more fuel you're using. 55 mph is the optimum speed on the highway. Authorities are again considering making 55 mph required on all highways in an effort to mandate fuel conservation. If they do that, you'll be well ahead of the game. On some highways in west Texas you can legally drive 80 mph. Gas mileage drops dramatically at this speed. Don't drive erratically. Strive for smooth starts and stops. Pick a lane and stay in it without weaving in and out of traffic. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.", 'During the digging for a new tunnel around eighteen thousand artifacts were found. Row houses, outhouses and evidence of Native American sites were discovered. Before cities collected trash, things that were not wanted were tossed into the outhouse. Today, the discovery of those spots can reveal generations of cultural change. Archaeology in cities is a relatively new field of study. It is the result of new laws and regulations. These new rules establish responsibilities for federal agencies that use federal money to do construction. They tell the agencies how to manage the handling of any evidence of past human activity', "The word yoga is derived from the word yoke, which means to bring together mind, body, and spirit. Many yoga enthusiasts practice this form of exercise for the calming effect it has on them in bringing peace into their lives. Some people claim it's more of a lifestyle than an exercise, and in some regards, they're right. It helps you gain control of your breathing while meditating and stretching into various poses that improve your cardiovascular functions. There are different forms of yoga. Some are fast paced poses that focus on strength training, stamina, and flexibility.", "If you're not quite sure she'll say yes to your wedding proposal, you won't want to risk a purchase from a store that won't accept returns.

They can plan what kind of ring they want and even get a custom design. They can also research the average prices for the kind of ring they want so they can prepare ahead of time. Some women still want the element of surprise", "The cow nose ray flaps its pectoral fins up and down like a bird. It is in constant motion. It dips and climbs, rarely resting on the seafloor. Another kind of ray swims along the seafloor. It's the spotted stingaree. Its fins ripple from front to back. This motion pushes the ray forward. It also lets the ray hover over prey. A ray uses its fins and tail together to help it move through the ocean. During a fight, a tail can also be a weapon. In a fight, the stingray cracks its tail like a whip. It stings its", 'Chipmunks have different colors and stripes. The eastern chipmunk is reddish brown. It has five dark stripes on its back. Between the dark stripes are two brown and two white stripes. The gray western chipmunk has five dark stripes and four light stripes. Most chipmunks are good tree climbers and swimmers. They eat nuts, seeds, wild fruits, and berries. Inside their cheeks are pouches. Chipmunks stuff these pouches with food to carry home. Each chipmunk has its own burrow, or hole. It contains at least two rooms. One is a storeroom for nuts. The other is a leaf-lined nest. Chipmunks', 'Skeletal muscle lies under the skin. It is made up of long threads, or fibers. Skeletal muscle controls movement, posture, and balance. A person can move skeletal muscle just by thinking about it and then doing it. Cordlike structures called tendons connect skeletal muscle to the skeleton. As skeletal muscle tightens, or contracts, it gets shorter. It pulls on the bones attached to it. As the muscle relaxes, it gets longer. It lets the bones fall back into place. In this way skeletal muscle makes the bones move the parts of the body. To make skeletal muscle move, the brain', "Most stars live for millions or billions of years. How long a star lives depends on how big it is. The largest and hottest stars have the shortest lives. These stars live for only a few million years. Smaller stars tend to live longer because they don't use up their fuel as fast. Our sun is about halfway through its life. We expect it to burn for another five billion years. A star's size also affects how it dies. When a star the size of our sun runs out of fuel, it puffs out its outer layers of gas.

Have you ever found yourself so engrossed in a book that you're focused on the pages and half an hour later, you realize that you didn't notice anything going on around you? You may have also found yourself in a zoned out state where you're so focused on one thing that you have no idea someone is talking to you at that moment. Hypnosis is akin to a zoned out state of consciousness. The person is well aware of what's happening, but they are only focused on the hypnotic attraction and", 'Negotiation is an added advantage of buying a used car. You can always negotiate with a seller of used cars. You cannot expect this facility, while buying a brand new car. If you have bargaining tactics, you can get a good deal. Nowadays, many car dealers are keeping their attention on offering great deals on used cars. It is important to decide how much you are willing to spend for a used car. This can help to narrow down your search.

If you need two of the item go ahead and buy them; but save by buying only one if that's what you need. For example, the sign may read: 15 limes for a dollar. Unless you're a big lime user, some could go bad before you use them. There was a time when some shoppers felt using coupons was not appreciated by the grocer and hesitated to use them. They didn't want to hold up the line while the checker scanned", "A volcano is an opening in Earth's crust. When a volcano erupts, hot gases and melted rock from deep within the Earth find their way up to the surface. This material may flow slowly out of a fissure, or crack, in the ground, or it may explode suddenly into the air. Volcanic eruptions may be very destructive. But they also create new landforms. There are more than fifteen hundred potentially active volcanoes in the world today. Strong volcanic eruptions throw bits of magma into the air. These bits cool into tiny pieces of rock, called volcanic dust or volcanic ash.", 'Tornadoes usually develop during thunderstorms, mainly in the spring and summer. Only a small portion of thunderstorms produce tornadoes, though. Sometimes a single thunderstorm produces a series of tornadoes, called tornado families. The appearance of several tornadoes over a broad region is called a tornado outbreak. Water droplets in the air make the whirling winds of a tornado visible. The visible column is called a funnel cloud. A funnel cloud may be shaped like a cone, pillar, or tube. It can range from a few feet to hundreds of feet wide. Once a tornado touches the ground, it travels across', 'The visible part of a tooth is called the crown. Several layers make up the crown. The outer layer is a hard white covering called enamel. Enamel protects the tooth from wear and tear. Below the enamel is dentin. This yellow, bonelike material is softer than enamel. Dentin makes up the largest part of the tooth. The center of a tooth is called the pulp. The pulp is soft tissue that contains blood and nerves. Nerves in the teeth send signals to the brain about heat, cold, or pain. The soft tissue around the base of each tooth is called', "Herb gardening is a relaxing type of gardening. If you're looking for a very simple type of gardening that doesn't require a lot of maintenance, herb gardening is probably a great choice. Most herbs are very hardy, and they don't require a lot of ongoing maintenance. If you choose mainly perennial herbs, you will have herbs that come back year after year with very little additional work. As long as you keep them watered and weeded, they should keep growing relatively well without a lot of additional work. Herb gardening is great for children and elderly individuals, as well as", 'Many of the forces within our atmosphere are easily recognized by us. This is due to the fact that we can use our senses to feel these forces. We can, for example, quickly determine the approximate temperature outside simply by stepping outside. We immediately know whether it is cold, warm or hot. Likewise, we can feel the amount of wind, or see the level of windiness by looking at how forcefully the trees are swaying back and forth. Even humidity is easily perceived. This is not the case with pressure. Atmospheric pressure is the amount of force or pressure exerted', "A new study shows that more and more kids are seriously injuring a part of their knee. The part that's getting hurt is known as the anterior cruciate ligament. This is not a bone, but a ligament something a bit like a rubber band. It helps hold the bones of your leg together. If the ligament is stretched too far or torn, serious problems result. It turns out that girls are more likely than boys to suffer this injury. The new study compared girls and boys playing the same sport. It found that girls are two to six times more", 'Massage and reflexology therapies are relaxation and healing techniques that help increase circulation and relieve tense and tight muscles. Until a few years ago, little information could be found on this growing healthcare field. Now, an astounding amount of alternative medicine books have been written and are continuing to appear in bookstores all over the world. A simple search on the internet will also reveal scientific studies as well as informative articles about alternative health care. Another reason that alternative methods of treating illnesses are becoming so popular, especially among westerners, is the high cost of traditional medical care. Health', "Hypnosis is defined as a trance like state in which a person becomes more aware and focused and is more open to suggestion. Many people get the wrong connotation of what that means, assuming they'll be enticed to quack like a duck or beep whenever someone says a particular word they hear. This is what you see on TV for entertainment; it's not how hypnosis really works for people using it to decrease stress, stop smoking, or encourage weight loss in their lives. You don't stare at a swinging object and instantly lose consciousness. It's done in a controlled, relaxing", "Every day the ocean absorbs about twenty two million tons of carbon dioxide. That's about the weight of fifteen million hybrid cars.

Since our brains are comprised of about 90 percent water, it's imperative that we hydrate them regularly and often by drinking lots of water, especially during stressful situations. Sometimes, memory loss and lack of ability to concentrate is blamed on aging, but if the brain is challenged on a regular basis it remains strong. The brain can be challenged or exercised in many different ways, including word puzzles, games, typing practice, and reading.", 'Many games have basic rules for winning, but others have unique requirements set down in order to be the victor. Some games are based purely on strategy where you must out think and outperform your opponent. Luck is a major factor in games requiring the rolling of dice, randomizing the results. To defeat your opponent, usually the victor needs to collect more points or gain a winning position on the board. How long it takes to learn a new board game will vary according to the particular game and person. A great advantage to playing board games is that beginners', 'For hobbyists that intend to use RVs for recreation, a toy trailer will work best. This is for those that will go on road trips to sand dunes and bring ATVs along. In toy trailers, the living area is compact to make room for the little garage at the back.

A biological clock seems to tick off the nighttime hours and ring an alarm in the brain to start the waking process. With the possible exception of viruses and bacteria, every form of life seems to have an internal means of measuring time. These internal clocks do not require the intricate action of muscles or nervous systems since they are found in most one celled plants and animals. They are probably wound by basic biochemical events within the cells.', 'Barter networks are great things. One of the main problems with the barter system is a business may find another business offering what they want, but the feeling is not mutual. The transaction will never happen without a facilitator. Most barter networks have something called trade dollars, and this is what helps them become the facilitator. So if a business charges $50 per hour for their time and barters 10 hours services, they are gifted 500 in trade dollars. They then use those trade dollars to purchase goods or services in the barter network that they require.

This will protect you from any interest rate increases while your loan is being processed which can be lengthy. If interest rates fall during the process this could work against you but most lenders will work with you if this happens. This may sound like a lot of work, and it's not unlike buying a car, but if saving money is your goal it's worth the effort.

And it's doing so despite massive efforts to stop it. There are four hundred edible varieties of banana, and many of them also are defenseless against panama disease. That's the name of the disease that this fungus causes. Indeed, many of those other types of bananas are important sources of food for millions of people outside the United States and Europe. It's the fourth type of fungus to cause panama disease that scientists have", "Clay has been one of the sculptor's chief materials since ancient times. Clay is easy to obtain and to use. Once early peoples learned to make bronze, metals became a popular choice for sculpture as well. Most metals are very strong and long lasting. Sculptors value their color and shine.

It took many years for the idea to catch back on because many other modes of self transportation received more public demand. The bicycle was vamped up to meet the needs of kids and adults, skateboards became more popular and kick scooters sort of lost their place in history.

You will know if there is a slippage problem if you try to accelerate from a stopped position. Vehicles with normal functioning transmissions allow for a smooth acceleration without hesitation, however a vehicle that may be experiencing a transmission problem would slow down this acceleration process and at the same time your vehicle's RPM spikes up. A jerking motion when putting the vehicle in gear or accelerating from a stand still would be a sign of gear slippage as well. Bad", 'Nuclear energy is used for peaceful purposes, too.

A very serious accident happened at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in what is now the country of Ukraine. Radioactive gases leaked out of the plant and into the air. They ruined crops and livestock and caused harm to many people.', "A great advantage to a longboard, due to its size and shape, is its buoyancy. This enables surfers to ride waves that are too small to propel on a short board. With all this being said, the longboard is more suitable for a beginner because of its large size and we strongly suggest learning on this type of board. Fun shape boards combine the elements of both short boards and longboards and are typically midsized, which is 7 to 8 feet in length. Fundamentally, the fun shape board's design allows waves to be caught more easily than a short board,", "The life sciences deal with living things and their surroundings. Biology is the study of the natural world and everything that lives in it. Botany, the study of plants, and zoology, the study of animals, are fields within biology. Medicine is the science of health. The social sciences deal with human life and culture. Sociology is the study of societies, or the groups that people form. Psychology is the study of the human mind and emotions. Geography is the study of earth's surface. Anthropology is the study of humans through history. Economics is the study of wealth.", "The most widely accepted mechanism for the origin of long duration GRBs is the collapsar model, in which the core of an extremely massive, low metallicity, rapidly rotating star collapses into a black hole in the final stages of its evolution. Matter near the star's core rains down towards the center and swirls into a high density accretion disk. The infall of this material into a black hole drives a pair of relativistic jets out along the rotational axis, which pummel through the stellar envelope and eventually break through the stellar surface and radiate as gamma rays. Some alternative models", 'Children everywhere enjoy playing with toys. A toy can be a simple ball, a game, or an expensive machine that uses the latest technology. Years ago most toys were made from wood and cloth. Today the most common material is plastic. Toys date back to ancient times. Scientists often find toys when they dig up old ruins. These include ancient balls, dolls, tops, and toy wagons and boats. They have also dug up game pieces. People have played games similar to chess, checkers, and backgammon for thousands of years. Many toys, from both ancient and modern times, look like objects', "Science includes a wide range of subjects. These subjects can be grouped into three branches, the physical sciences, the life sciences, and the social sciences. The physical sciences deal with non living things from the tiny particles that make up an atom to the universe itself. Physics is the study of matter and the forces that act on it. Chemistry is the study of substances. Astronomy is the study of stars, planets, and other objects in outer space. The Earth sciences are the study of Earth's features. Mathematics, the study of numbers, is a physical science, too. It is also", 'Most gems are hard minerals that are found naturally in the earth. However, a few gems come from animals or plants. Pearls form inside the shells of oysters, clams, and other animals called mollusks. Amber is tree sap that has fossilized, or turned to stone. Jet is a hard form of brown coal, which is made from fossilized plants. Coral comes from the skeletons of sea animals called corals. The color of gems ranges from colorless to pure black. Gems may be transparent or opaque, which means that light cannot shine through them. Among the rarest and most valuable gems', "The world's largest body of water, the pacific ocean, covers about one third of the earth's surface. This massive ocean is double the size of the atlantic and contains twice its volume of water. The area of the pacific ocean, without its surrounding seas, is 165 million square kilometers. All of the continental land masses on the planet could be placed in the pacific ocean, and there would still be room left over. Although the pacific ocean has an average depth of about 4000 meters, the lowest known point on earth, the Mariana trench, is approximately 10.9 kilometers deep. More", 'These three muscle types are Skeletal muscles, Smooth muscles, and Cardiac muscles. Skeletal muscles are usually attached to bones. They are often called striated muscles because of their striated, or striped appearance. The cells of skeletal muscles can be very long, sometimes over 30 cm, and can contain many different nuclei. Your brain usually tells your skeletal muscles what to do. Skeletal muscles are mainly used in movement, such as when you wiggle your toes, wave your hand, and smile. Your body contains many muscles which are not under the control of your brain, but rather operate on their own', 'In a number of games the players use a racket to hit a ball or other object. The most popular and widely played of these games is tennis. Another racket sport is badminton, in which the players hit a feathered cork rather than a ball. Most of the other racket sports including such popular games as racquets, racquetball, and squash racquets require a special enclosure for play. These games resemble handball in that the play involves bouncing the ball off the walls or floor of the playing area. All of these games may be played by either two or four', 'Jewelry is any object other than clothes that is worn to decorate the body. People use many different materials in making jewelry. Fine jewelry is made of valuable metals, such as gold and silver, and beautiful stones called gems. Jewelry that is made of plastic, steel, ceramics, glass, or other less costly materials is called costume jewelry. People who still live as their ancient ancestors did make jewelry from bone, claws, animal hair, wood, and shells. People wear jewelry for many reasons. Kings, queens, and other leaders have often worn fine jewelry at important ceremonies and events. Some people wear', "Soccer is the world's most popular team sport. In most parts of the world the game is called football or association football. Both men and women play soccer in schools, clubs, and on national and professional teams. In a soccer game two teams compete to score more points, which are called goals. The players move the ball around a rectangular field, usually by kicking it. A team scores when it sends the ball into the opposing team's goal. During a soccer game the players of each team spread across the field in loose formations. A formation generally has front, back,", "New research shows that having a pet dog can help to reduce children's stress. A study shows that petting a dog is a great way to help stressed kids. Researchers looked at over six hundred children aged six and seven over an eighteen month period. They found that children who have a pet dog suffer from less stress than children without a dog. The researchers said that just twelve percent of children with pets showed signs of stress. This compares with twenty one percent of children with no dog. The research will come as no surprise to the parents of", "What can be done about space trash? A good first step is to make less of it. Scientists are designing tools that are harder to lose. For example, it can be easy for an astronaut to drop a camera lens cap. It's harder to lose the cap if it is tied to a camera. Special shields can protect astronauts and spacecraft, too. Astronauts wear spacesuits with a layer of bullet-proof material. This protects them from small pieces of trash, which could slice through their suits. Scientists are looking for ways to clean up space waste. No one country is responsible", "The asteroid belt is the region of the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by many irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The asteroid belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt because there are other asteroids in the Solar System such as near Earth asteroids and Trojan asteroids. Maybe half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. These have mean diameters of more than 400km, while Ceres, the asteroid belt's only identified dwarf planet,", 'The prize money awarded to each first place male and female increased from $500 at the inaugural games to $250,000 in 2011 and 2012. Athletes at the games compete in workouts they learn about only hours beforehand, sometimes including surprise elements that are not part of the typical crossfit regimen. The games are styled as a venue for determining the fittest on earth, where competitors should be ready for anything. In 2011, the games adopted an online format for the sectional event, facilitating participation by athletes worldwide. During the crossfit open, a new workout is released each week.', "During a volcanic eruption, hot melted rock called magma escapes from a vent, or opening, in Earth's surface, or crust. Magma released from a volcano is known as lava. It glows red as it flows out of the volcano's opening. As it cools, it hardens into rock. Strong volcanic eruptions throw bits of magma into the air. These bits cool into tiny pieces of rock, called volcanic dust or volcanic ash. Wind can carry volcanic dust thousands of miles away. Volcanic ash can coat the land for miles around the volcano. Steam and poisonous gases also escape from volcanoes. Sometimes", 'Roller skating is a recreational and competitive sport in which the participants use roller skates, shoes or boots with small wheels attached to the bottom. Roller skaters skate outdoors on sidewalks and other paved areas. They also skate indoors in buildings called rinks. Roller skating sports include hockey, speed skating, figure skating, and dancing competitions. These are similar to traditional ice skating sports. Today roller skaters also take part in so called extreme sports such as vertical skating, which involves aerial acrobatics performed off ramps or in a half pipe, and street skating, which involves riding through urban environments and', 'Asthma and allergy attacks have increased despite the fact that our outdoor air quality has improved. Some researchers think these problems have increased because kids are spending too much time indoors. When outdoors, we are exposed to pollens and dust and other irritants. But when indoors, we are also exposed to allergens. Allergens are proteins that originate from mold, pets and dust mites. Allergens cause allergies and most people know that allergies can make you sneeze and have runny and itchy eyes. But allergens can also trigger asthma attacks, which are more serious. Asthma symptoms include shortness of breath, especially', 'A fly tickling the hair on your arm can spark a maddening itch. Now, scientists have spotted nerve cells in mice that curb this light twiddling sensation. If humans have similar itch busters, the results could lead to treatments for the millions of people who suffer from chronic, unstoppable itch. For many of these people, there are currently no good treatments. All touch sensations including itch start at the skin. In recent years, scientists have started to learn how nerve cells carry itchy signals from there to the spinal cord and on up to the brain. Often the original itch', "The sea turtle's new home is the warm waters along Florida's east coast. With a larger shell, she is safer in the near shore waters than she was as a hatchling. Though she sometimes slurps up a jellyfish, the turtle now eats mostly algae and sea grass. The sea turtle slowly grows larger. Soon she moves to feeding grounds farther off shore where she grows into an adult. There, she eats a sea grass called turtle grass. At night, the turtle rests in the water under rocks and ledges. She can hold her breath for up to five hours. Each", 'Pets have been a wonderful asset to many families. Some can help with the farm work, some can control the mouse populations and others can keep us calm and relaxed with their mere presence. More people are getting various breeds of pets these days as they realize the effect they can have, not only on your physical health but your emotional health as well. Studies have shown that pets can reduce heart ailments, which is one of the reasons some nursing homes bring pets in every so often to let the residents there spend some time with them. Pets provide', "Learning to play the guitar can be an extremely rewarding experience, but it is made even more so if you find the right teacher who is also a guide that will help you achieve your musical goals with the right resources. The best teachers always prepare and have a plan: it's said in teaching that for every hour of teaching you need to prepare twice as much. You should be able to tell whether you're dealing with a professional just with your first meeting. They will determine where you are, where you are trying to go and then propose a", 'As airfares become more competitive, traveling by airplanes has become the preferred means of travel for millions of people around the world. Although it may seem that airfares are getting more expensive, the reality of the situation is that airfares are comparatively cheaper. In many countries, it is actually more expensive to travel by train with airfares are about the same as a bus ticket. While competitive prices may seem good, the increasing rush at airport terminals means that flying is not the same luxurious affair that it used to be. Thankfully, there is a way to get around the', 'Dogs are not always well thought of. Dogs in the city have been in the center of controversy. Some people have criticized dog owners for allowing their pets to soil sidewalks and lawns, although in some cities laws oblige owners to clean up after their dogs. Urban dog owners have argued that the animals serve as protection against vandals and burglars and thus protect their detractors as well as their owners. When a person decides to own a dog, he should be prepared to care for it properly. For a dog to stay healthy it must be correctly fed and', 'The legs of all mammals share the same basic structure. A knee joint links the upper and lower segments of each leg. At the bottom of each leg is a foot. Muscles make the legs move. Bones make them strong. On four legged mammals, the legs are attached underneath the body. The hind legs of these mammals resemble the legs of humans. Three long bones are found in hind legs and in human legs. The tibia and the fibula connect the ankle to the knee. The femur connects the knee to the pelvis. The forelegs of four-legged mammals can be', 'Eighty percent of all business drones may be used for agriculture. Small and cheap aerial drones can help farmers put weed killers and plant fertilizers precisely where the chemicals are needed. They can identify especially dry areas of a field, directing irrigation systems to those spots without wasting water elsewhere. The aerial robots also can spot predators in livestock herds, and direct farmers to those locations. Drone technology is getting better. Things like 3D images and temperature readings from drones could be combined with other information. Farmers would get even more information about growing conditions. It would help farmers to', "The middle coat holds the eye's main blood supply. The iris, or colored part of the eye, makes up the front part of this coat. Light passes through an opening, called the pupil, in the center of the iris. The iris opens and closes to allow more or less light through the pupil. Behind the iris sits the lens. The lens focuses light onto the inner coat of the eye. The muscle that holds the lens in place also adjusts its shape. To focus on objects that are near, the lens thickens. To focus on objects that are far away,", 'Although some light curves can be roughly reproduced using certain simplified models, little progress has been made in understanding the full diversity observed. Many classification schemes have been proposed, but these are often based solely on differences in the appearance of light curves and may not always reflect a true physical difference in the progenitors of the explosions. However, plots of the distribution of the observed duration for a large number of gamma ray bursts show a clear bimodality, suggesting the existence of two separate populations: a short population with an average duration of about 0.3 seconds and a long', 'The best placement of the arms is a ninety degree angle next to your mid section. The torso is another area that is affected by the positioning of your head, neck and shoulders. If you are looking out in front of you with a relaxed shoulder your torso will automatically come along from the ride. Make yourself as tall as possible in the torso region. This will give your chest room to expand, encouraging air flow and circulation. What about those hips? Your hips will naturally align correctly if the rest of your body is doing what we have advised', 'Water always seems to have a soothing, calming effect on people. It is beautiful, sparkling, and gentle. Water gardens can certainly add interest to an otherwise bland yard. They can include waterfalls, ponds, fountains, and aquatic plants. Generally, water gardens are ponds or containers of water that house plants, and sometimes also contain fish or other aquatic animals. You need to be sure to pick a spot that gets a lot of sun, because most fish and aquatic plants need quite a bit. The best spot is a place that gets at least six or eight hours of sun every', "A clutch of eggs lies hidden more than two feet below the sand on Costa Rica's Tortuguero beach. The nest holds more than 100 eggs each about the size of a golf ball. Inside each one, there may be a baby green sea turtle. The temperature of the sand determines whether sea turtles hatch as male or female. The sand is warm, so more of the hatchlings will be female. One of the turtles begins to stir inside the shell. She tears at it with the sharp point on her beak. Still buried beneath the sand, she breaks free from", "What if a machine could sniff out scents too dull, dainty or dangerous for human noses? Such a device could sniff out toxic chemical leaks, ripening crops or even human diseases. In fact, engineers are developing electronic noses to do each of these tasks. One device that has been designed measures tiny traces of chemicals in a person's breath. Eventually they may help to monitor, control or even diagnose different diseases. One version of the electronic nose could help people with type 1 diabetes. They do not make enough insulin to control the blood sugar released during the digestion of", "Over the years dogs have performed various services. They have pulled sleds over snowy tracts. They have delivered messages, herded sheep and cattle, and even rescued persons trapped in the snow. Dogs are also trained as guard dogs in peacetime. Because of their keen sense of smell, dogs are used by police to track down escaped prisoners. Law enforcement agencies also rely on the dog's acute sense of smell to uncover illegal drugs, and at airports dogs detect plants, foods, explosives, and other forbidden items in travelers luggage. Some specially trained dogs aid deaf or handicapped people, others serve as", "How strong can glue be? A super strong glue was tested to see how much weight it could hold. The ends of two metal rods were glued together. The rods were used to lift and hold up a forklift weighing over seventeen thousand pounds for one hour! The rods did not come apart. So what's tape? Tape is made from a plastic strip with a special kind of glue sprayed onto it. This glue is not as loose as regular glue but still works with positive and negative charges. Tape is good for sticking stuff together but tape can also", "Water covers 70 percent of earth's surface, yet most of it is unusable, which is why many people around the world struggle to get enough of it. Nearly 97 percent is salty or otherwise undrinkable. Another two percent is locked up in glaciers and ice caps. That leaves only one percent. People, plants, and animals depend on that one percent of fresh water. Each drop of water is always on the move. The water we drink is a liquid. It can also be a solid or a vapor. No matter what state of matter it's in, all water is connected.", 'So what exactly should you go for when buying a RV? Like with the other important decisions in life, planning is very vital before you head out and buy your RV. The first thing to consider is the purpose of your RV. Are you planning to buy a motorhome that you can use for your annual family trip? In such case, renting one would be more advisable. Whether you will use it often or seldom, the maintenance and storage costs are given and these are extra burdens on your finances. There are also some people that intend to buy RVs', "Animals mess up all the time. They might eat a poisonous berry, fall off a tree or let their prey slip away. By watching other members of their species fail, an animal can avoid making the same mistakes. This may improve its chance of survival. Scientists suspected that one part of the brain, the medial frontal cortex, helps animals process information about others' errors. Cells in that region appear to become more active when a person blunders or sees someone else making a mistake. But researchers didn't know whether individual cells in this part of the brain play different roles", "A new study shows that more and more kids are seriously injuring a part of their knee. The part that's getting hurt is known as the anterior cruciate ligament. This is not a bone, but a ligament something a bit like a rubber band. It helps hold the bones of your leg together. If the it is stretched too far or torn, serious problems result. It turns out that girls are more likely than boys to suffer this injury. The new study compared girls and boys playing the same sport. It found that girls are two to six times more", "Want to be a great doctor or scientist? Make sure you play video games. New research shows that certain video games can help people find things better and faster. For instance, if a doctor is looking for something on an xray, or if a scientist is looking at a satellite image, they may be able to do it better if they've trained by playing video games. Certain video games, like driving games, can improve a person's visual search skills. That's the ability to see something that's hidden in the middle of a confusing field of things. Like finding Waldo.", 'This rules out a link to massive stars, confirming that short events are physically distinct from long events. In addition, there has been no association with supernovae. The true nature of these objects, or even whether the current classification scheme is accurate, remains unknown, although the leading hypothesis is that they originate from the mergers of binary neutron stars. A small fraction of short gamma ray bursts are probably produced by giant flares from soft gamma repeaters in nearby galaxies. Gamma ray bursts are very bright as observed from earth despite their typically immense distances.', 'The crayon is a drawing implement made of clay, chalk, plumbago, dry color, and wax. There are two types of crayon: the coloring crayon and the chalk crayon. The coloring crayon, or wax crayon, is the one used by children in making pictures. It consists of waxes such as paraffin, beeswax, and carnauba wax and dry color. Some synthetic waxlike materials are also used in the modern crayon. The waxes are melted and the dry color added with continuous mixing until thoroughly dispersed. Normally, the crayon is entirely consumed during the marking process through abrasion.', 'If you do feel your shoulders starting to get tense and creeping towards your neck it is best to breathe and take a second to shake out your shoulders. Releasing built up tension is the ultimate reason people run. You can help yourself relax and stay in the rhythm you are creating by keeping your shoulders loose and low. Many people think running is a lower body sport. However, including your arms is an absolute must in keeping a proper running form. Your hands should be unclenched and relaxed with your arms moving forward and backward along to your stride.']
